right sax where do you want to go you want to go Fox I'm willing to do foxes I mean Fox is kind of crazy uh okay so Rupert Murdoch had been uh deposed here with this Dominion voting system lawsuit they're suing Fox for 1.6 billion in Damages over claims made on air that we all know around technology-enabled election fraud we remember this wild period at the end of the last election cycle with this incredibly false claim that the election was stolen something you know both sides of the aisle said did not happen however it seems that the hosts on Fox knew it wasn't happening it knew it wasn't true but were engaging uh in entertainment of allowing these people to come on air and say the election was stolen so Murdoch said I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight and when asked if he could have stopped the host from highlighting these allegations these false allegations on air that were obvious to everybody he said I could have but it didn't he said the truth he's not allowed to lie in court yeah just on air I mean uh sax to be fair like um you uh really care about freedom of speech you really care about the libel laws you really care about the GOP obviously you bring it up every week here so when you looked at and but you were very clear you were not happy about the election denial all that like false claims that Trump made and these insane people he put around himself so how do you look at these foxhoes and listen you've been on Tucker and other things knowingly spreading lies about something as important as the election and then doing it in the most cynical ways we we sit here and every week we roast the media the mainstream media you particularly go after the Dems and the left and the media Elites how do you feel about these media Elites who are part of the GOP machine lying incessantly about something as important as the election Integrity of the United States of America first of all you're trying to tee this up as some giant dunk on me Jay Cal I am not no I'm not you said from the beginning you didn't believe in this exactly let's go back to December of 2020 on this show because there may be a lot of parts of the audience that weren't watching back then I was really clear that I said Sydney Powell and 100 and Rudy Giuliani I thought they were wackos and this whole idea that the Dominion voting machines have somehow been rigged and somehow it involved Hugo Chavez was a wild conspiracy theory so I said at the time 100 and I also said that I thought that once the Supreme Court denied certiorio Trump yeah I said that he had his right to have his day in court and to challenge the election in court but once that the court threw out his claims and the Supreme Court denied sir shiori that that whole thing needs to stop and it didn't stop and that's why the Republicans lost that uh Purdue runoff seat in Georgia on January 5th and you had January 6th so you know I've been warning against this for a long time Jake owl now with respect to to Fox I think you need to basically get a little bit more nuanced in what you're saying there because I think within Fox there were actually two groups of hosts so there is one group of hosts that I think you could say were Trump Loyalists and they basically not only platformed the Sydney Powell lies but also endorsed them and Rupert Murdoch admitted that they went too far and actually endorsed and so you had Hannity and a couple other hosts do that even though Hannity had some text messages that indicated he didn't believe it so I think he came across the worst however there were within Fox Skeptics of the Sydney pal Theory and so I put Tucker Carlson in that camp I put Laurie Ingram in that camp and Tucker had Sydney Powell on his show on I think it was November 19th I think this was 16 days after the election it was a 20-minute interview in which he grilled her and he kept coming back to what is your evidence what is your proof and if you were paying attention he demolished her I mean I remember that notable yeah exactly so I mean honestly no one looks great when all of your text messages come out and you can nitpick about this or that text but the bottom line is I think Tucker did his job you know yes he platforms Sydney Powell but he platformed her in order to dismantle her and you kind of have to be pretty Dopey not just to see that she was dismantled after the appearance be liable for knowingly platforming these people and endorsing them in some way or is it their freedom of speech in your mind as an attorney here uh or somebody with that uh you know legal degree where does it stand like put aside if this was if this was CNN doing it MSNBC we'll switch what publication if this was the New York Times and they knowingly lied knowingly platformed some Kooks with a conspiracy theory what should the price they pay for and then how does that affect the freedom of speech that we all think I think universally on this podcast especially and in Silicon Valley or at least we used to that freedom of speech is really important do you have the freedom to lie and platform Kooks like this let me answer you directly Jason I think this would be a better world if Fox reliable but I don't think they're going to be because that's not the legal standard I believe that if a television network knowingly spreads and endorses baseless accusations against somebody which they know or should know is basically untrue I think they should absolutely be liable for libel or defamation but that is not what the law requires under New York Times versus Sullivan you're required to show that that they knowingly spread misinformation but in addition you have to show that they had actual malice which is that their intent was malicious and I think you know Rupert Murdoch is a Wily old dog because he admitted on the stand everything but the thing that was most important for the plaintiffs to prove which is actual malice he admitted that they platform things that they you know knew or should have known were false he admitted that he should have put a lid on it sooner he admitted that he knew it wasn't true but he said the reason they did it is because they're afraid of Their audience or a portion of Their audience going to some rival Network so basically what he said is in not so many words is that his motivation was greed and in our system of law that is a complete offense against claims of deformation now I think what we need here is to rewrite the defamation laws I think the Supreme Court needs to overturn New York versus Sullivan Clarence Thomas is basically uh intubated that he would support that I think that would be a great thing to do I think actual malice should not be the requirement if reliable I think of a television network or a publication puts out information they know is false they should absolutely be liable for it and that is enough to show and if we did that by the way it wouldn't just be fox in this particular case it'd be CNN and MSNBC we have to completely revise their coverage and all of these Tech reporters who do nothing but to fame the tech industry the entire Tech press just about is a slow moving defamation lawsuit Elon Musk would probably be the richest man in the world just based on all the defamation lawsuits he could bring if we were to overturn New York Times versus the richest richier guy yeah because all they do is to fame Elon Musk every week which claims that are ridiculous there you go folks very very intellectually honest I like it David so what you're saying is you expect the Dominion lawsuit to fail can it be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court can this be the case that rewrites New York versus Sullivan good question that's a good question I'm not sure I mean I think that'd be great if it did just be clear listen I think that if Fox Were Somehow found guilty I think one and a half billion is a kind of a ridiculous amount of Damages I don't think Dominion was damaged to one half billion but do I think that it would be a good thing if this lawsuit were challenged all the way Supreme Court and they overruled New York Times versus Sullivan let's fund the lawsuit I would fund that lawsuit is not is is Sue MSNBC and CNN for all the nonsense they spread every night yeah just to be clear I have a couple things that I would want to go and um get correct clean up I just want to be clear here though Brad David's guy Tucker he did the right thing that's the most important part of the story isn't it David that you're still listening you're not being Nuance you want to throw a Tucker under the bus I think Tucker did his job I think Tucker did his paradoxical job yes yeah I think the guy who looks a little worse is Hannity because the Hannity in the text admitted he didn't believe the story but as a trump loyalist he endorsed the Theory that's really good Brad you we uh you know you you come on the show every couple of episodes and pitch in here as our fifth Beatle would you like to touch the third rail what are your thoughts and uh would you like to get some incoming email from all your LPS about your position on Fox News and I mean we just I just feel like I sat through a University of Chicago Law School class it was awesome and great I think we have some good issues here that we still got to tick off on jaycal yes okay well we gotta talk just for a second about China as it relates to tick tock because because all right here we go this Holly hearing that's coming up so we've got a hearing in Congress let's start with you are a shareholder a significant shareholder in bike dance the parent company of tick tock we have to say that correct correct correct you started that position and my kids use reels and everybody you and I have had a spirited debate on yes you're a shareholder okay about this so I so I haven't you want me to Tee It Up you want to see it but hold on a second here like because just like sax had to defend himself before he even got started otherwise I have to do the same okay here we go shareholder of meta who stand s to do incredibly well if Tick Tock in the US is banned so you have a spread wait you win either way I've got a hedge on good okay you know if Tick Tock in the U.S gets banned but you know the con the context here is the tick tock band debate is heating up right and it's all in a March up to the Holly hearing I think it's on March 23rd and there's real like we we spent a lot of time at the start of this pod on inflation I think a much bigger issue right now I was just with all these investors the main issue on their mind was Global decoupling between China and the United States we're going to see a level of Chinese hate leveled out of out of Congress both sides I mean we heard it chamoth at dinner at your place not so long ago that this hearing is drawing more demand for speakers from both sides of the aisle than any such conference uh in a long time but there's a lot of there's a lot of heat now around tick tock should it be banned and when I when I look at the situation if you frame it for bike dance because Shema talked about this a couple weeks ago it's been reported bite dances revenue is about 120 billion dollars it's been reported their profits are about 25 billion dollars that is almost identical in size to meta meta's worth about 450 billion so 120 billion Top Line it's also been leaked that in that Tick Tock is about 14 billion of that and that U.S Tick Tock is three to four billion U.S Tick Tock three to four billion of a hundred and twenty and it loses money so there's a lot of debate should we ban it should we not ban it is it going to go public and what should happen what do you think what do you want to ask and as a shareholder listen I think it's about an American I think this is a puppet debate over a much bigger conversation that's going on one of the things I've urged the company to do over the course of the last several years is parental controls my kids use tick tock they use reels and what I want is to be able to set effective time limits and I also want Tick Tock has incredible uh video content in math in science and history I want to be able to set a slider and say 20 of the videos that get shown over this one hour period have to include some of these math and science videos for my 12 year old then he can elect and not watch at all or watch it they announced those product changes yesterday um so they're teeing up those product changes I don't happen to think there's a nefarious plot but I also understand that people might not want this and so like listen I think we should have a debate I think that the CEO of tick tock should show up he should speak the the truth at the Holly hearing and if the U.S Congress wants to ban Tick-Tock in the U.S or force a spin or a sale I think we should do it and stop debating it but the much larger conversation is whether we have a hard or a soft decoupling with China and I think this is just Canary in the coal line all right so let me just tee up also uh and chamoth I'll get your reaction on Monday the White House gave government agencies 30 days to remove tick tock from all federal devices all federal agencies must lead Tick Tock from phones and systems and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the company this is following moves by Canada in the EU and Taiwan and uh obviously there is a bigger house committee focused on China that held its first meeting this week so there is the bigger picture but let's start with the smaller picture number one do you think it's a security risk to have a Chinese company have this kind of access and influence with Tick Tock specifically and what do you think the remedy should be for that and then we'll get big picture and we'll get snacks involved in this as well should it be banned should they have this kind of access to Americans and influence should it be banned no because I believe in a free market will it be banned yes because it's the most obvious cultural way to pick a fight with China without actually picking a fight with China so yeah I think it's going to be the most obvious victim of all of this and so I don't know my advice to my friends who are shareholders not just Brad but others is sell sell it move on it's in the Warren Buffett what Warren Buffett calls the two hard bucket sax uh do you think that this is a national security issue do you personally believe Tick Tock should be banned or do you like me believe that we should just do a reciprocation test in order for tick tock to be allowed here in the United States then Twitter Facebook meta Instagram LinkedIn Etc need to be allowed in China and you have this many days to reciprocate or else it's banned I don't think Jamal is right that tick tock's going to be GPC roadkill and GPC stands for great power competition you're going to start hearing that term more and more it's going to become the organizing principle of American foreign policy and I just think that Tick Tock is Tick Tock is all caught up in that and you know personally I'd like to understand what it is exactly that they're doing with Tick Tock and instead of just having these vague accusations I actually really like to understand yeah I'd like to know a lot more about that but in any event I just think you're going to get caught up in this this again GPC that's going to be the the dominant organizing principle of our foreign policy I think that people are coming around to realizing that it's China not Russia that is the central Global competitor and adversary of the United States it's the only country in the world that's a potential pure competitor to the U.S this economy is roughly the same size as the U.S it's got four times the population it's the one that we really need to watch out for I think there's growing realization in Washington that the Ukraine war is a little bit of a misdirect and that we need to basically get back to doing what we were doing before the war which is pivoting to Asia and by the way thinking about that just for a second in I think David you're totally right because the game theory now to me makes a lot more sense in the frame in the framing of GPC so for example if you think about what the chips act does right the chips Act basically says we are going to near shore or onshore every capability we need so that we can make and manufacture all the critical semiconductors for all of our interests technological business military Etc but what is that really what that is is an option to not have to defend Taiwan and why is that important it's because today if Taiwan were invaded by China we get pulled into a conflagration that we don't know how it ends we don't know what the beginning middle of end of it looks like it's extremely dangerous and precarious so spend a couple trillion dollars create Financial incentives build a bridge to Korea and to Japan so that they bring onshore into Mexico all the capabilities we need with Western Europe who are already our allies already along with Japan and Korea and now all of a sudden we have complete optionality and now we can deal with the greater Chinese hegemony in a much more balanced way so I think the GPC framing is shared by the way between the Democrats and the Republicans so this is why it's so much bigger than one single company that's why I think I think tick tock's roadkill Brad if you frame it as a competition we're not framing it as a war we're in competition and part of that is going to be this decoupling is this decoupling helpful to America is it helpful to humanity is it better that we decouple a bit this interdependency maybe got a little too deep as we saw during covid with uh Supply chains well I mean it's a great in a great power struggle it is what the words imply right so I don't you know part of the reason you want to have trade uh with China and part of the reason we don't want to have a hard decoupling is uh you know a long-standing theory that company countries that trade together are less likely to go to war so you know I think if you listen to what's coming out of this you know these uh Select Committee this week that held its first hearing is on the on the extremes you hear people saying hard to coupling right and in the middle you have people saying listen we need to define a circumference around National Security and we need to decouple as to all things that are within that circumference now I will tell you that the debate is about how large is that Circle so it starts off as for example sophisticated computer chips out of Nvidia so China you know can't compete with us in the AI arms race but it's quickly emerged into you know batteries energy food supply chains the circumference has now become almost as large as the economy itself I would argue that it's not just the chips act it's also Ira which is another trillion dollars of funding for uh basically onshore and Supply chains vital materials to build batteries Etc you know so I think it's a very reasonable policy by both parties to pursue it's clear that we're going to have some decoupling I think it's a it's a it's going to lead to an interesting question on the part of China you know she was out last week saying you know I'm going to make a speech about peace with Russia you know this is more David's territory but my hunch is that there may be you know if China China thinks it's going to be a hard decoupling from an economic perspective this is bad for global economic growth this is bad for China's growth I don't think it's bad for growth I think it's bad for inflation explain well because I think that we'll have many versions of everything everywhere so we will some more redundancy yeah more redundancy we're going to rely on Central and South America in a meaningfully bigger way and what that'll mean is that there'll be more jobs in economic prosperity for those countries they'll feed the United States China will feed it less and as a result there'll be more inflation because you won't have the cost advantages by the way China is not just going to sit there and take this line down they've already punched back a few times so for example on the middle of the summer China introduced a tariff and slowing the export of certain materials and Technology to make solar Wafers now why is that critical well again talked about this before but we are going to take the marginal cost of energy to zero in this country and the levelized cost of energy particularly via solar is the cheapest it's ever been and so what China sees is oh my gosh if the United States has abundant free energy now all of a sudden a huge component of what drives costs is gone yep so now the United States could partner with El Salvador Mexico Honduras you know Argentina Brazil it's happening here too yeah no but I'm just saying it's close by yes right and if you can deliver zero cost energy to those places now the manufacturing capability could exist there my point is it's such a complicated chess piece so China is not taking any of this line down but I think that what David's framing is totally accurate this is the beginning of a GPC and it's an economic Tit for Tat that we're going to play out we tax chips they tax solar panels we go after tick tock just as a confusion maker right yeah I can tell you the the there's a very easy test for if China sees Tick Tock as a strategic asset and that's it's going to create more shareholder value Brad if they were to spin it out and make it a publicly traded American company with American sharehold it would create more shareholder value for bike dance therefore if they don't spit it out that means they're not acting in the interest of shareholders and shareholder value they're acting the interest of their National Security pretty clear reciprocation and collaboration would be a much better model I think for for working with the Chinese and hopefully we can find some things and we can collaborate on Brad raised the the
