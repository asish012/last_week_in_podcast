Argentina with Hooters I was 19 and it was only the second opening I had led fully and I get down to Buenos Aires and of course the franchisee had gone through training and we had a menu and specifications and equipment that they were supposed to have for the business and I I get down there and they had done everything we told them bought all the kitchen equipment almost identical menu is in the US and as we started training the cooks it became apparent that there was a problem they were disgruntled saying this food is bad and I can't believe we have to do this and at first I was like what's going on I realized by talking to the cooks and the trainers that we had brought down that Argentina I would then learn is the beef Capital One of the beef capitals of the world and we had an embarrassingly low quality ribeye steak sandwich that we were requiring them to cook on a flat top grill which was an abomination in Argentina in the U.S if you want a steak sandwich take a ribeye slap it on a flat top grill a little bit of olive oil sear it how do you want it cooked medium medium well put it on your Texas toast sandwich with some cheese and onions and there you go it was it was so viewed as so low quality that it was insulting there not only the choice of the the beef which should have been alternatively hyper local source to be of the quality that is expected even in casual dining there it was the equipment it was that it wasn't on open flame and I remember that fork in the road where I thought what do I do I'm here representing the company these are the franchise standards they clearly signed up for it they bought it it's here do I just toe the line and say nope sorry this is the menu get over it or do I listen and take that feedback and make a decision to change oh by the way this is before iPhones were really prominent and I think I had a pager at that point and we were still using facts to communicate any changes so it was very difficult for me to communicate with the corporate office and so I didn't have the permission or the experience with such a situation to know exactly what I should do but I sat down with the franchisee and I said uh here's all the criticism and there is a pattern it's not one else there were many other things like having beans on the menu baked beans are really popular in the U.S at that time it was considered a poor person's food a Popper's food in Argentina and if it was on the menu it meant you were a lower grade restaurant and so there were many of these situations that were clearly the result now I can say of us not having deep local cultural knowledge and so I talked to him about it I was very honest about the struggle that I'm hearing it I believe it I want to do something about it I understand it has financial implications and I don't even know if it's going to be approved and he looked at me and he said anytime it's one of my favorite pieces of advice anytime you are criticized assume first it's correct just allow yourself to digest that and then respond and either you will you will reaffirm that the criticism is not correct and you can focus more on the why and a productive relationship or you realize there's at least some grain of truth and you will work intensely to address that issue and it was so helpful and so inspiring because the right thing to do for the customer and the employees not necessarily the head of marketing of Hooters restaurants at the time who probably would have said no if I had asked the right thing to do for the right people the right stakeholders was to make the change was to get in a new piece of equipment that was a flame you know an open flame piece of equipment on which to cook meat allow the franchisee to help us locally Source better cuts of meat make some changes take beans off the menu do a few things differently reprint the menus and open with that new menu and that's what we did is there an example where you ever did that and you get in trouble after oh I got in trouble for that the head of supply chain and purchasing who manage the food specs he let me know that that was not my job um that I was out of line that this is not I do not own this brand and do not have the right to make these changes I mean it made me teary you know it like I'm a young employee and I thought I was doing the right thing and I had some reinforcement from some Executives but the one who's like approving the specification sheet and who by the way when I come back to the U.S I need to keep working with was angry was audibly angry luckily I leaned on the vice president of training her name's Cheryl and I remember calling her and I was upset and I felt comfortable being upset with her and I was like I'm so sorry you know I thought I was doing the right thing I know you support it but this other executive is really upset and I don't know what to do because I can't I'm down I'm down here you guys aren't I can't undo this decision that I still think is the right decision and just you know allies and Advocates and mentors and all the words you want to use are so important she said don't worry he's just crotchety he'll get over it you're doing the best you can we'll get better at this as we do more of it the company was growing and I was caught in the crosshairs of the company growing faster than it was ready to grow and having those human-centered Executives can really keep top employees kind of in the game despite the fact that they're causing friction and because I was the one going into these countries I was known for friction you know I got to the point where after I did it enough I was mature enough to go look you guys need to be better at this right I'm down here dealing with this reactively and then when I became an executive at 26 now running these departments I had the drive and the the mission to get much much better proactively as a result from episode 151 Alan malali and I think

    "Title":"Learning to Adapt to Local Culture in Business",
    "Summary":"In this video, a former head of marketing for Hooters restaurant chain shares an experience of opening a new location in Argentina where they encountered challenges due to cultural differences. The restaurant menu was identical to the one in the US, including serving a low-quality ribeye steak sandwich, which was insulting to locals. The author was at a crossroads, whether to stick to the company's standards or listen to the customer feedback and adapt to local culture. He chose the latter and was criticized by the head of supply chain and purchasing. However, he was able to convince the franchisee and allies to make the necessary changes and succeeded in launching the new menu. The video emphasizes the importance of deep local cultural knowledge and being willing to listen to feedback in business operations."
