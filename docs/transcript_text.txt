[0, "foreign [Music] project podcast I'm your host Shane Parish the goal of this show is to master the best of what other people have already figured out to do that I sit down with people at the top of their game to uncover the useful lessons that you can learn and apply in life and business over the last five years I've been lucky enough to speak with some of the most incredible people in the world when I listen to past episodes one thing that stands out is how well the insights from these conversations stand the test of time they're as relevant and insightful today as when they were originally recorded and in a world that encourages a treadmill of perishable information it's worth revisiting wisdom that doesn't expire so a few times a year we'll go back to earlier episodes some of which you may have missed some of which you may have forgotten and pull out some Timeless gems around a single theme the theme for this episode is leadership you'll hear from Jim Collins who defines leadership and examines history to see how context-dependent good leadership really is then leadership coach Jennifer Berger shares the Practical insights that separate average and great leaders Randall stutman from the admired Leadership Institute discusses the importance of giving feedback something he says everyone knows how to do but in reality they get very wrong it's not enough to give feedback how you do it makes all the difference cat Cole the president and CEO of athletic greens talks about the importance of doing right versus being right the challenges of leading a business in different cultures and a unique heuristic for accepting criticism Alan malali the former CEO of Ford will teach us the elements of his working together management system that helps you lead any team through principles and empowerment and finally Diana Chapman co-founder of the conscious leadership group teaches us some crucial advice about running a team the importance of unrelenting Candor and how teams can more effectively make decisions it's time to listen and learn [Music] from episode 67 here is Jim Collins I I don't know if someone else can make someone a leader I don't know if you can teach leadership but I'm pretty sure you can learn it and I think that distinction is key I think it's very arrogant to say that you or I or anyone else could take someone and I'm going to teach you leadership but I watch people learn it and I think a big part of what it takes to learn it there's kind of two things that would would well let me highlight one for the moment embracing the idea of seeing what has to be done and then exercising the art of getting people to want to join you in getting it done but it starts with Clarity of something's got to be done and I am not going to be a bystander so when I look at for example the the School principles that I that I studied I I know this one superintendent let me just tell you this story it sort of grew into a leader takes over a school district sees that that school district had kits from previous years before this person was in charge what you're not really in charge but was superintendent where there had been low graduation rates a whole bunch of kids had not graduated from high school and he takes one look at it and says this is just wrong somebody's got to do something so you would think well then great that person is going to lead people to do what's necessary to increase graduation rates but here was the extra leadership step when you recognize something is just wrong something's just got to be done somebody's got to step forward I can't be a bystander right he looks at it and he says we have to take responsibility for the kids before I was superintendent who didn't graduate and we're going to go find them and we're going to create a program to bring them back into the schools and we're going to make sure that they get out with our high school degree I'm going to take responsibility to make sure that happens for the kids who were here before I was even superintendent and I'm going to walk down to a building in this town and I'm going to say we need space for this you have an extra floor in your building you need to help these kids because somebody's got to do something will you join me and give us space so we can bring them back and get them their degrees so what is leadership Eisenhower put in his leadership as the art of getting people to want to do what must be done it's an art form and everybody is a different kind of an artist some are painter summer sculptors some are orders some are good at like just getting the right people together around the table some are good at admonitions some are really good at asking a right question right as different kinds of art but it's an art and you learn from others you don't copy them you you get your own Artistry of getting people to want to join you and not being a bystander about"], 

[315, "what's got to be done those people are coming over the hill someone's got to do something those kids didn't get their education someone's got to do something this product has incredible potential someone's got to do something and you infuse that in folks to be able to to do that that is I think where the real start of the leadership begins uh hey we got this computer we made it for ourselves somebody's got to do something to bring this to a whole bunch of other people because it's so cool we can sit here and think it's cool or we can do something and I think that's the seed bed of where the leading really begins second one of the people and I think I've actually asked him if I could write this so I think I can share this story uh one of the great four-star general officers fellow named General Austin who really had a profound impact on me when I ventured off the West Point and he held the chair two times after me it was actually the most recent shareholder for uh the class of 51 chair he was one of the only four star generals to come out of his era uh his class at West Point uh he might be the only one but certainly one of the only ones ended up with a very storied career spectacular leader and he told me the story about part way through his career he uh he was worried a little bit about you know promotions is he getting promoted fast enough his career right and one day he just woke up and changed and he said I'm not going to take care of my career anymore I'm going to take care of my people and the moment I did that everything changed because they wouldn't let me fail when young people come to me asking I'd like some career advice my first response is let's just stop asking that question what have you done for someone else how can I be useful how can I be useful how can I take care of my people take care of your people not your career and and in general Austin ended up as a spectacular leader and I think those two"], 

[440, "sorts of things If you're sort of thinking about seed bits of how we would help young people grow into the leaders that our world desperately needs in all walks of life it's one don't be a bystander see what has to be done and someone's got to do something and if you feel someone's got to do something then you can exercise the art of getting people to want to do what you see must be done with you the second is stop taking care of your career start taking care of your people and if you do that then they won't let you fail so I don't know if an outside entity you know you know I certainly couldn't like make somebody a leader but I think people can learn it and I think that's kind of some of the Catalyst and the leavening of the bread based on what I've seen and I'm really optimistic I mean I think that if I stand back and I look at the Young leaders that are coming up the ones I met at West Point a lot of the ones that I've that are on my research team young people that I meet in life we live in an era when it's easy to for people to feel pessimistic I I absolutely reject I'm incredibly optimistic and my reason I'm optimistic is because what I see in the leadership capabilities of the generations that are coming and I think we'll be in very good hands one more question about leadership because I just can't help myself but like how much of leadership do you think is contextual or as somebody we think of as an exemplary leader in one situation would be a mediocre or below in another situation so obviously there's a contextual element to everything and I think that's something you talked to earlier about about even decision making was this idea that there isn't kind of an isolated perfect Universe when we don't live on a euclidean grid and and there's context and there's certainly social context uh what we know from social psychology that you know almost everything is is affected by social context and you never know how you're going to behave how you're going to react in any given situation until you're there and that's why we should always be very humble about our own sense of ourselves knowing that we'll always act in a certain way because you actually don't know under certain pressures so you should be very humble about that so context matters a lot that said uh I think what the evidence very clearly shows me is that I can see leaders who learn how to be effective across very different kinds of contexts and so for example let's take Eisenhower phenomenal example your supreme commander of Allied Forces before that you were relatively undistinguished major you were brought up by General Marshall and so forth but you know being a five-star which there's only been five five star generals I believe in the history of the US military but being a five-star general is a very different leadership context than being president in a political system and now but what's also interesting is along the way he also went to be a president of the university and really struggled there so what you have with Eisenhower is you've got a two wins and one which was not as much of a win which is the presidency of"], 

[630, "the University what does Eisenhower's case show it shows number one that two very different contacts he could be enormously successful he was successful in both military and presidential but in a university setting he was less successful from episode 43 Jennifer Garvey Berger so much of leadership ability is about how other people experience themselves in your presence right so a great leader has a presence that makes other people bigger I was either a client who's a chief executive of a big company and I was with him a couple of weeks ago watching him as he met with people and as he had his meeting and the way he speaks to people brings out their goodness right you can see people actually kind of kind of grow in his presence they they feel more comfortable to take risks they feel more comfortable to say a thing that maybe is controversial they they have more room to play and you can actually watch it kind of physically happen in their bodies they stand a little straighter they look them in the eye they smile they've got this kind of resonance that I think a truly stupendous leader brings into the world and are you differentiating this between a charismatic leader as we're kind of"], 

[720, "taught hot and this sort of amplifying leader that you're you're kind of talking a bit or do I have that wrong no you're totally right a charismatic leader when he walks into the room or she walks into the room makes you feel good about her or him right like I walk into the room and I'm a charismatic leader and you think wow and you think about that person a great leader I think you are that great leader walks into the room and you feel bigger like you don't think wow what a great leader you think wow I'm willing to say this thing I feel more comfortable in my own skin I'm just having ideas I haven't had before like a great leader makes other people better and I think that's the fundamental difference between kind of the charismatic heroic image of leadership that has gotten that has been a help for us and also a hindrance for us as a human race for a long time and the kind of leadership that we need now the kind of leadership that the world is calling for from us now which is not about having one person and following that one person but having someone who can create the conditions that make us all better make us all bigger smarter more creative more moral just better I want to come back to the variable are there any other variables but before we get there why is it different right now like what has changed that causes the maybe the type of leadership that is required going forward is not the type of leadership that maybe we historically get us to where we are I think the world is just so complex Shane right that that it it can be that that Mark charismatic leader that person could know enough about the market the market was going to be similar over time that person could predict things pretty well and that person could say let's go that away and be pretty sure that that away was good and so we talk about Leaders with these strong visions and you know all that kind of stuff right now like who knows right who knows what's gonna happen next anybody who tells you they know what's going to happen next with the media or with Professional Services firms or in the tech industry or the insurance industry or whatever like those people are delusional we don't know what's going to happen next the thing that we know is it's going to be different from now and so we meet a different kind of leadership to lead us into the unknown and to and that sort of leadership needs to help other people be bigger because we need more Collective force of leadership than any one human being can hold okay I I want to come back to that and I think we can explore that when we talk more about complexity and the knife and framework a little bit later in the conversation so going back to the variables that you would kind of look at to assess leadership ability the amplification is one what are the others"]]
