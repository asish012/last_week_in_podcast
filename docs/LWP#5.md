{"Title": "Leadership Lessons from Jim Collins", "Summary": "Jim Collins discusses leadership and how it can be learned. He believes that leadership is not something that can be taught but can be learned. There are two things that can be done to learn leadership: firstly, embracing the idea of seeing what has to be done and then exercising the art of getting people to want to join you in getting it done. Secondly, stop taking care of your career and start taking care of your people. If you do that, then they won't let you fail."}
{"Title":"Effective Leadership: Amplifying and Curiosity","Summary":"Jennifer Garvey Berger explains in this video that effective leadership is about how other people experience themselves in the leader's presence. A great leader amplifies other people's goodness and makes them bigger. This is different from the charismatic leader, who makes you feel good about them. Leaders need to be curious about the world and other people's perspectives. They must not be too certain about their own beliefs, and they must be open to learning from others. The world is now too complex to be led by a single person, and leaders need to create the conditions that make everyone better."}
{"Title": "Mastering the Art of Giving Feedback", "Summary": "In this video, Randall Stutman discusses the difficulties of giving feedback and how to become a better feedback giver. The most important part of feedback is how the message is delivered. Stutman distinguishes between technique and routine and encourages moving towards routine. He also highlights the negativity effect and how to balance negative and positive feedback. An example of a presentation is given to illustrate this idea."}
