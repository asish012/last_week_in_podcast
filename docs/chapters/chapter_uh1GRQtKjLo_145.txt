from episode 67 here is Jim Collins I I don't know if someone else can make someone a leader I don't know if you can teach leadership but I'm pretty sure you can learn it and I think that distinction is key I think it's very arrogant to say that you or I or anyone else could take someone and I'm going to teach you leadership but I watch people learn it and I think a big part of what it takes to learn it there's kind of two things that would would well let me highlight one for the moment embracing the idea of seeing what has to be done and then exercising the art of getting people to want to join you in getting it done but it starts with Clarity of something's got to be done and I am not going to be a bystander so when I look at for example the the School principles that I that I studied I I know this one superintendent let me just tell you this story it sort of grew into a leader takes over a school district sees that that school district had kits from previous years before this person was in charge what you're not really in charge but was superintendent where there had been low graduation rates a whole bunch of kids had not graduated from high school and he takes one look at it and says this is just wrong somebody's got to do something so you would think well then great that person is going to lead people to do what's necessary to increase graduation rates but here was the extra leadership step when you recognize something is just wrong something's just got to be done somebody's got to step forward I can't be a bystander right he looks at it and he says we have to take responsibility for the kids before I was superintendent who didn't graduate and we're going to go find them and we're going to create a program to bring them back into the schools and we're going to make sure that they get out with our high school degree I'm going to take responsibility to make sure that happens for the kids who were here before I was even superintendent and I'm going to walk down to a building in this town and I'm going to say we need space for this you have an extra floor in your building you need to help these kids because somebody's got to do something will you join me and give us space so we can bring them back and get them their degrees so what is leadership Eisenhower put in his leadership as the art of getting people to want to do what must be done it's an art form and everybody is a different kind of an artist some are painter summer sculptors some are orders some are good at like just getting the right people together around the table some are good at admonitions some are really good at asking a right question right as different kinds of art but it's an art and you learn from others you don't copy them you you get your own Artistry of getting people to want to join you and not being a bystander about what's got to be done those people are coming over the hill someone's got to do something those kids didn't get their education someone's got to do something this product has incredible potential someone's got to do something and you infuse that in folks to be able to to do that that is I think where the real start of the leadership begins uh hey we got this computer we made it for ourselves somebody's got to do something to bring this to a whole bunch of other people because it's so cool we can sit here and think it's cool or we can do something and I think that's the seed bed of where the leading really begins second one of the people and I think I've actually asked him if I could write this so I think I can share this story uh one of the great four-star general officers fellow named General Austin who really had a profound impact on me when I ventured off the West Point and he held the chair two times after me it was actually the most recent shareholder for uh the class of 51 chair he was one of the only four star generals to come out of his era uh his class at West Point uh he might be the only one but certainly one of the only ones ended up with a very storied career spectacular leader and he told me the story about part way through his career he uh he was worried a little bit about you know promotions is he getting promoted fast enough his career right and one day he just woke up and changed and he said I'm not going to take care of my career anymore I'm going to take care of my people and the moment I did that everything changed because they wouldn't let me fail when young people come to me asking I'd like some career advice my first response is let's just stop asking that question what have you done for someone else how can I be useful how can I be useful how can I take care of my people take care of your people not your career and and in general Austin ended up as a spectacular leader and I think those two sorts of things If you're sort of thinking about seed bits of how we would help young people grow into the leaders that our world desperately needs in all walks of life it's one don't be a bystander see what has to be done and someone's got to do something and if you feel someone's got to do something then you can exercise the art of getting people to want to do what you see must be done with you the second is stop taking care of your career start taking care of your people and if you do that then they won't let you fail so I don't know if an outside entity you know you know I certainly couldn't like make somebody a leader but I think people can learn it and I think that's kind of some of the Catalyst and the leavening of the bread based on what I've seen and I'm really optimistic I mean I think that if I stand back and I look at the Young leaders that are coming up the ones I met at West Point a lot of the ones that I've that are on my research team young people that I meet in life we live in an era when it's easy to for people to feel pessimistic I I absolutely reject I'm incredibly optimistic and my reason I'm optimistic is because what I see in the leadership capabilities of the generations that are coming and I think we'll be in very good hands one more question about leadership because I just can't help myself but like how much of leadership do you think is contextual or as somebody we think of as an exemplary leader in one situation would be a mediocre or below in another situation so obviously there's a contextual element to everything and I think that's something you talked to earlier about about even decision making was this idea that there isn't kind of an isolated perfect Universe when we don't live on a euclidean grid and and there's context and there's certainly social context uh what we know from social psychology that you know almost everything is is affected by social context and you never know how you're going to behave how you're going to react in any given situation until you're there and that's why we should always be very humble about our own sense of ourselves knowing that we'll always act in a certain way because you actually don't know under certain pressures so you should be very humble about that so context matters a lot that said uh I think what the evidence very clearly shows me is that I can see leaders who learn how to be effective across very different kinds of contexts and so for example let's take Eisenhower phenomenal example your supreme commander of Allied Forces before that you were relatively undistinguished major you were brought up by General Marshall and so forth but you know being a five-star which there's only been five five star generals I believe in the history of the US military but being a five-star general is a very different leadership context than being president in a political system and now but what's also interesting is along the way he also went to be a president of the university and really struggled there so what you have with Eisenhower is you've got a two wins and one which was not as much of a win which is the presidency of the University what does Eisenhower's case show it shows number one that two very different contacts he could be enormously successful he was successful in both military and presidential but in a university setting he was less successful from episode 43 Jennifer

    "Title":"Learning Leadership: Two Key Elements",
    "Summary":"In this video, Jim Collins discusses two key elements in learning leadership. The first element is seeing what has to be done and not being a bystander; and the second element is taking care of your people instead of taking care of your career. He explains that leadership is an art that can be learned from others, and that everyone has their own unique way of exercising it. Collins provides examples of leaders who have exercised these two elements effectively."
