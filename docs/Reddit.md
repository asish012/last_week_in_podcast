Hi podcast listeners & creators,
I belong to the first group (listeners). I enjoy a wide variety of podcasts, mostly entrepreneurial, technological, and business-related podcasts.
I started publishing a newsletter that summarizes some of the most popular episodes from the past week. This newsletter is published every week and consists of 4-5 podcasts. This offers insights into the topics discussed in the episode and if they seem interesting enough, you can then listen to the entire episode (or specific parts). 
It would be greatly appreciated if you could take a look and give feedback.

Note: The podcast summaries are created with the help of self-written Python scripts and OpenAI.
