from episode 96 Randall stutman so feedback's really difficult because you know there's no question that what we say and mostly when we say it is pretty contextual like no one would ever be able to come up with the universal that says always say this in this situation or always do this and even when the timing of things really is is very precise to what's happening what already happened what's going to happen and so forth so but when we when you study really fabulous leaders what you learn is that the universal of feedback is how they carry messages so how do they offer criticism how do they offer feedback what are some of the things that they do that are very specific and then you start to learn things that once you hear them you naturally start to subscribe to a view that says oh there's something there I can do better at that that's a really important part the other pieces is when When I Look to the Practical literature of feedback what you generally get is some useful ideas without any question but but they don't have that Universal applicability where I can practice them and they work all the time so I don't become very masterful at them so it's the difference between what I normally call technique and routine so so feedback is the classic area that that occurs in and that is so let's just say that I subscribe to the idea that um I should ask you for permission for me to give you feedback now I can see the conditions by which that would be a good idea or not a good idea it speaks to relationships and power and all kinds of things so I like the behavior um it's a it's a fairly broad piece of advice that's given inside there but it doesn't work in all situations there's a lot of cases where you shouldn't ask for permission there's a lot of cases where you've given people feedback over and over again they haven't acted on it there's cases where in situations you'll find yourself in where people want to deflect and and want to resist the feedback that you want so asking permission they they'll never find the right time or energy to do that in the like a routine is something you do because you want to be that person that's the kind of way that you want to give feedback as an example you want to commit to that this is and so you master you do it all the time and all the feedback that you give and you become masterful at that piece and you do it on on a consistent basis people come to know it as part of your style so they don't see it as out of the ordinary and and now you become more and more skillful at it until it's almost second nature and it becomes a habit so we're after trying to teach leaders how to move things to routine and not do them for the point of technique so can you bring it into one yeah give me an example of one of these behaviors let's take the idea of balance the simple balance and and and and by the way you know this one this is in your head I'm just going to be very specific about it okay and it's going to take me a little little while to really unpack this one because it's got a lot of different pieces to it but I think you'll find it rather fascinating so so no surprise um we all have a natural natural and intuitive understanding that negative information carries a lot more impact and weight than positive information so even when I think you've done a lousy job I'll normally start it with some throwaway like ah that went pretty well like yeah you really worked hard at that like oh you know the audience seemed to really like like that one piece you'll start out with some softening of the blow all right because number one you you want people to hear you but number two you naturally know that if you go negative to start with it people withdraw they shut down they don't they react they do all kinds of things so so so naturally what happens is we start to offer feedback most feedback and criticism most of it other than praise and flattery and so forth has has a negative tinge to it and so not all not all not all of it but a lot but more of it when you when you're trying to improve people's performance you're giving them at least constructive criticism around try this differently do this and so forth so because we know that the negative and the positive are very different and because we know the negative is overweighted it's called a negativity effect by the way not not my research we naturally buffer almost everything we say on a scale we start with a little bit of positive and then we offer a little negative and then we then we get to our negative now if I do that consistently if I give you one little positive and then I give you my four criticisms the balance is is not there it's actually out of bounds right so so let's take an example of uh of that just real simply let's just say let's take the idea example of a presentation I'm just going to make it make it up on top of my head but let me give you two two pieces of feedback presentation right so my first feedback goes hey the presentation went pretty well I think the audience was engaged but listen you know your slide in the deck slide 10 it was like not just not really understandable in slide 15 confused everybody you know I didn't think you tied the introduction to your conclusion so you lost people when at the end when you got to q a you started out okay but boy you were really flat footed on the second question and your answer was really weak and I thought the audience was not as responsive at the end as they should have been across the presentation and you're thinking wow okay I mean really you thought the thing went okay and that the audience was fairly engaged like I don't remember that but I remember you just you just crapped a lot on everything that I just did and I don't hear much of that by the way but let me give you a different one uh different view let me give you the same feedback but in Balance so the individuals instead the leader says to you listen I think the the audience was was engaged across your your presentation I I think it went pretty well I want to tell you that uh I never saw slide eight before and I thought it was masterful I thought you took something really complex and made it simple I thought when you reached uh before you got to q a when you reached your main point um I thought that you hit it hard several times to the point where it resonated with the group I think they were excited to get to q a to ask you questions I thought you started out q a really well and and I believe that your answer to the fourth question which was the hardest question of all around like why we do what we do you you just hit it out of the park now let me be critical on the other side okay you know your slide five was was indecipherable we got to do something about that your slide 10 like really made took something that um was was uh complex and made it even more complex I didn't think you tied the introduction inclusion nearly strongly enough I thought when you got to the Q a your second answer to the second question was really flat-footed and really left people wanting and I think the or the overall people could have been a lot more engaged if some of those things were fixed that's an example of the difference between feedback imbalance versus feedback being totally out of bounds because I don't know anybody that wants the first one there are a lot of people that don't want the second one either by the way but if you really want to get better you want the second one and you can deal with the balance of it so now what is what did we learn I'm not telling you anything yet I haven't told you the behavior yet so the behavior is not just about being in Balance it's about how you're in bounds and when we study the really best leaders the best leaders on the planet the most admired leaders in everywhere they all do the same thing they all start positive just like we all do intuitively when we're going to be critical but they're positive is as Vivid elaborate and as um detailed as the negatives are going to be and they generally match in terms of number so if I'm going to give you five criticisms I probably need to have three or four or five really positive things but they can't just be at a level of vividness or detail that is not equal to what I'm going to do in a second so if I'm going to focus I'm going to start positive and I'm going to go as as deep into that positive as I can and by the way if if I tell this to leaders all the time they'll say well I have five criticisms but I only have one really good positive that I can focus on I well first of all I'll tell them stretch yourself right see if you can come up with two right but more importantly they're only ready to hear from you two criticisms right now because the only way to keep that in balance and again it doesn't have to be perfect doesn't it be two to two or three to three but it needs to be slowly or or somewhat imbalanced to do so now what I also think is interesting about that behavior is when you become masterful at it you practice it all the time there is no criticism that you can't give that's in balance none and the balance is not about what you say it's about how again starting positive how detailed how Vivid how elaborate are are you in the positive as well as the negative but let's look at a different aspect of the balance issue which I think is equally fascinating which is all relationships are in Balance either in positive or negative because almost everything that a leader says to somebody that reports to them or works with them is either positive or negative there's not a lot of neutral and that's true with teachers and and students it's true with parents and children okay with the power relationship exists almost everything so so I'll leave it to people like John gottman and other people that talk about marriages because the same thing would apply to marriages but let's just talk about leader relationships how quickly they can get out of balance every time I talk to you I'm focused on trying to get you to be better but in the process I'm giving you negative feedback I'm giving you criticism uh yeah I might Spike on a couple of things that that I say are positive but I'm out of balance and so what happens is when you have a relationship that has almost always negative information negative feedback versus positive then what happens is people withdraw they basically stop listening or they react and so you know I I can't tell you how many leaders I've dealt with in my life who will say I have a team member or I have a child in my life and every time I say something even before I get it out they're defensive they're counter arguing they're right and and I know immediately it's because they feel as if their relationship with that person is out of balance that they have to defend themselves because the the equation is hugely negative to positive and so there they know and criticism is coming their way and they're bracing against it which is why they're counting or arguing or they're turning off or they're sulking before you even finish or they shake their head before they you even get the whole idea and so anytime a relationship is out of balance negative to positive in terms of the general feedback and criticisms that are offered in that relationship you're gonna get you're going to have that evaluative climate and it's going to go hugely negative now the opposite is equally problematic by the way especially with children you can have relationship that is really really positive all you say is positive stuff there's very little negative so it's out of balance that way and most people would say to me well how can that be a problem it's a problem because what happens is when I do offer a piece of criticism where somebody else does people freak out they they they're not ready for it because they've only heard positives several examples one of my favorite examples is I sat down with a leader who had gotten 15 years of positive performance reviews got a brand new leader and that leader was fairly critical and that leader in their first review gave them a very honest what I thought was an honest and fair review but they couldn't see it as honest affair because they had been used to so much superlative for so many years from so many leaders that were not courageous enough to be honest with them that they absolutely went catatonic when they saw this particular feedback which I thought was just objective um that happens with kids all the time too if you want to really prepare children for Success you have to give them a nice balance of feedback positive negative again doesn't have to be perfect but too much positive makes it so that people get alarmist when they hear negative and too much negative means people defend themselves on a good basis you and I can do better by striving to be more in balance in our relationships and then when we are going to be specifically in a critical moment trying to make somebody better with feedback we need to start positive and make that that positive set of remarks be as Vivid and elaborate and as detailed as the negative is going to be that's a behavior that you'll find that almost everybody that's great at feedback athletic coaches that are fabulous dance instructors leaders we've studied in corporates and the like they all tend to do it in some form or another they're in better balance than everybody else which is why people accept their feedback a lot differently you and I can start doing that better tomorrow we could look at any of our relationships right now and say which of my relationships is out of balance which ones do I have more negative to positive more positive to negative am I am I in balance in my marriage and my imbalance with my kids and my imbalance with each of my team members and then we also have the ability then to say okay tomorrow I'm going to be preparing to give you some feedback on something that just happened how do I prepare myself what are the positives and what are the and how do I describe them vividly let me I don't have to rehearse let me get ready to be in Balance so that I can practice this and make this a natural part of my leadership that's a behavior that we consider an admired leader of feedback from episode 117 cat call when I was in
