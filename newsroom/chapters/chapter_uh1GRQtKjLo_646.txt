Garvey Berger so much of leadership ability is about how other people experience themselves in your presence right so a great leader has a presence that makes other people bigger I was either a client who's a chief executive of a big company and I was with him a couple of weeks ago watching him as he met with people and as he had his meeting and the way he speaks to people brings out their goodness right you can see people actually kind of kind of grow in his presence they they feel more comfortable to take risks they feel more comfortable to say a thing that maybe is controversial they they have more room to play and you can actually watch it kind of physically happen in their bodies they stand a little straighter they look them in the eye they smile they've got this kind of resonance that I think a truly stupendous leader brings into the world and are you differentiating this between a charismatic leader as we're kind of taught hot and this sort of amplifying leader that you're you're kind of talking a bit or do I have that wrong no you're totally right a charismatic leader when he walks into the room or she walks into the room makes you feel good about her or him right like I walk into the room and I'm a charismatic leader and you think wow and you think about that person a great leader I think you are that great leader walks into the room and you feel bigger like you don't think wow what a great leader you think wow I'm willing to say this thing I feel more comfortable in my own skin I'm just having ideas I haven't had before like a great leader makes other people better and I think that's the fundamental difference between kind of the charismatic heroic image of leadership that has gotten that has been a help for us and also a hindrance for us as a human race for a long time and the kind of leadership that we need now the kind of leadership that the world is calling for from us now which is not about having one person and following that one person but having someone who can create the conditions that make us all better make us all bigger smarter more creative more moral just better I want to come back to the variable are there any other variables but before we get there why is it different right now like what has changed that causes the maybe the type of leadership that is required going forward is not the type of leadership that maybe we historically get us to where we are I think the world is just so complex Shane right that that it it can be that that Mark charismatic leader that person could know enough about the market the market was going to be similar over time that person could predict things pretty well and that person could say let's go that away and be pretty sure that that away was good and so we talk about Leaders with these strong visions and you know all that kind of stuff right now like who knows right who knows what's gonna happen next anybody who tells you they know what's going to happen next with the media or with Professional Services firms or in the tech industry or the insurance industry or whatever like those people are delusional we don't know what's going to happen next the thing that we know is it's going to be different from now and so we meet a different kind of leadership to lead us into the unknown and to and that sort of leadership needs to help other people be bigger because we need more Collective force of leadership than any one human being can hold okay I I want to come back to that and I think we can explore that when we talk more about complexity and the knife and framework a little bit later in the conversation so going back to the variables that you would kind of look at to assess leadership ability the amplification is one what are the others curiosity about the world right a curiosity about other people's perspectives a leader who feels certain cannot be learning from other people so the more sure you are as a leader about exactly what's right and what's wrong exactly where you're going the less open you will be to hearing that you're wrong until it's too late whereas a leader with more curiosity more openness to other people's perspective which can be totally cultivated right you don't have to be born that way you can you can achieve that with effort um a leader with more curiosity about those things is much more likely to be able to pick up on little signals that make a big difference before bad things happen like history is filled with leaders who were told in Whispers that there was disaster ahead and who were so certain about their own perspective that they marched into disaster had on right a curious leader listens to Whispers And begins to make sense of them not necessarily to believe them all but to know that there's something going on to be attuned to okay that makes a lot of sense so amplification curiosity uh not being certain about their own beliefs I guess but that that also conflicts with what we think of as leadership I mean when we look at political leaders uh you know they do amplify but they are you know I don't know if they're curious but they appear very certain when they're up there debating that they have all the answers I I can't remember the last time I heard a politician go I don't know and they're asked a variety of questions from like healthcare to budgeting and they seemingly have all these answers how do you look at that um with trepidation um I I think that this world of I mean particularly in politics but the the world of the sound bite has not been our friend right the the sound bite that tries to put in a a sentence or a phrase um the complexity of an actual issue is necessarily misleading and partial and the more addicted we get to sound bites and the more hyping up we get by them then the more simple our leadership will be as opposed to the more complex it it takes it takes a little bit of effort and a little bit of slowing down and a little bit of breathing to get your head around a really complex situation you can't do it instantly and you can't do it in a sound bite and so that's why we have these like bizarre challenges these days about this super simplistic problem solving that in a complex world just tends to create bigger and bigger problems

    "Title":"The Qualities of a Great Leader", 
    "Summary":"A great leader has a presence that makes others feel bigger, smarter, and more creative. The kind of leadership needed today is not about having one person to follow but someone who can create conditions that make us all better. The qualities of a great leader include amplification and curiosity. A curious leader listens to whispers and begins to make sense of them, not necessarily believing them all but to know that something is going on and to be attuned to it."
