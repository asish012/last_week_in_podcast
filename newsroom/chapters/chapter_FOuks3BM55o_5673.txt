Chinese peace proposal in Ukraine which I think said an interesting topic can we do you guys want to go there for a minute sure uh yeah all right can I take a shot explain what the Chinese were doing I think it was a clever diplomatic maneuver by the Chinese to try and grab the moral High Ground here they're basically saying listen we're interested in peace we're going to put forward a proposal the Americans fell into the Trap of basically dismissing it right away throwing cold water on it the U.S state department has done this twice before remember back in March of last year enough tolly Bennett from Israel tried to negotiate a peace deal and he himself said that it was the West the Americans who rejected it he thought it had a 50 50 chance of succeeding you then had the peace process in Istanbul Turkey with erdogan presiding over it you had the the Istanbul communique which again they were very close to having a peace deal and blinking in the U.S threw cold water on it so what's happening here is that the U.S is not playing its traditional role as Peacemaker where we try to go in and mediate these conflicts we're doing the opposite of that we're throwing cold water in the peace process now why are we not acting as the mediator I'll tell you why but because we are a co-belligerent this is an American proxy war that we're fighting against Russia so we have no interest in mediating a peace process and moreover we're not trusted to mediate a peace process because we're one of the effectively strategy by Xi Jinping yes to take the global moral High Ground I I agree with that no no I said it on Twitter a couple weeks ago like this this is amazing that he's starting the peace process we want regime change we want to deplete and we want to ankle Putin they want to keep him in the game the more despots there are the the worse the better it is for them they would like to keep the Legion of Doom uh going they don't want to see regime change in democracy in Russia eventually I don't think that's how they view it but listen Jake how is very close to getting it but here's where I would disagree with you a little bit let me explain okay go ahead so from the Chinese point of view the war in Ukraine is like Mana from Heaven okay they love this war number one okay because it's interfering with the US's pivot to Asia we were basically in the process of redeploying all of our force all of our military to containing them in East Asia and now we're bogged down in Europe okay so that's number one number two we are massively depleting our stockpiles of of weapons we've used something like nine years of stingers and five years of javelins and we're running out of ammunition I can't believe we're running out of artillery the Russians actually have a six to one artillery Advantage which is why they're actually doing much better in this war than people are acknowledging we should come back to that the last thing is that the Chinese now are benefiting from the economic sanctions on Russia because Russia is now selling them oil and gas and all their minerals so it's been this has been a wonderful thing from the Chinese standpoint so this is the problem with us thinking in this Marvel movie Way of the World in which we're the Super Friends and we're against the Legion of Doom okay is because there is no natural Alliance in the real world between China Russia and Iran these are three very different regimes with different types of governments who naturally would not get along they would be adversaries naturally they'd be suspicious of each other as China and Russia were during the Cold War but we have pushed them closer together this is the problem with having this overly moralistic view of foreign policy over to you Jason what do you think is there a question is there a question what's the question yeah I mean you frame it as the Legion of Doom so just explain well it's the axis of Evil the the the 50 uh Brainiac would not be working together if it weren't for us declaring a war on both of them actually Pakistan Iran and and China work together on nuclear technology so they do when it's convenient for them work on things like nuclear bombs so uh there is an affiliation but you're correct they're they're the 50 of the planet of humans on this planet who live under authoritarians and so they they're authoritarians they're always going to think in their own interests they're always going to think in their own interests above their own peoples let alone the people of another country they don't care they don't care about human rights if they don't care about the rights of humans and they certainly don't care about the rights of humans in another country and the West is uh on a noble mission to spread democracy in the world and that is a noble Thing Worth Fighting For and is worth defending free countries from despots I know that you are a fan of these folks sacks apparently and you think they should be able to run amok I will take the other side of it I think the West should act in unison the only criticism I have is that we are not acting in unison I would like to see the West instead of sending Biden to Ukraine hold on we've talked enough you just accuse me of somehow being fans of these people where did I ever say that I was a fan of XI and China or Putin or the ayatollahs in Iran hold on you said we provoked Putin Putin invaded another country hold on we caused it hold on a second I am arguing for a geopolitical strategy that benefits the United States I'm on Team America and your policy of driving these people into an axis of Evil is foolish for the reason I said which is we are going to power up the Chinese economy so they are a much more formidable enemy to the United States that is the last thing we need to do now with respected hold on a second let me finished you had a chance with respect to Ukraine and Putin there there's no question that Putin invaded okay he is the aggressor however the question you have to ask is why and the fact of the matter is that first of all we fermented a coup in Ukraine in 2014 this is your democracy spreading that you like is all of a sudden we got these ngos and we got Victoria Newland from the state department in there basically fermenting these coups it doesn't work out quite the way you think Jay Cal that's problem number one okay then we try to run NATO right up to Russia's border okay and you expect them just to accept that because we're a benevolent superpower that's not the way the real world Works Putin was tremendously threatened by that and it wasn't just him it was all Russian Elites read the bill Byrd's member from 2008 yeah it means that he explains that even the liberal elements within Russia were tremendously threatened by NATO expansion that is what basically poisoned diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia and it was a major cause of this war now listen just because you don't think it's provocative doesn't mean that the Russians don't think it's provocative you have to be able to put yourself in the other guy's shoes for just one second and the fact that matter is is there are diplomatic steps that we could have taken to defuse this crisis in this war and we didn't do it and now look what's happened hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and Ukraine's been destroyed it's been absolutely destroyed and let me tell you right now it looks like they're losing this war so I don't see where your superhero policy has gotten us except to make China richer and more powerful and to destroy Ukraine that is where your naive idealism has gotten us yeah and I would say if you if if left to your devices and you are not engaging and not presenting a united front against Putin he will invade country after country the West must fight for democracy we must fight for human rights even if it's uncomfortable and you seem to think we provoked him to invade this country he's a murdering dictator authoritarian who has been murdering his own people I'm saying other people for his entire career and he will continue to do so let me clarify because you're putting words in my mouth okay when you say that I think that we believe believe what I believe is that we took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative I'm saying that from their subjective point of view they saw these actions as provocative they said so listen the Russian which is what I said we provoked it is your position no yes I just explained that's not the words hold on his position is that in their eyes they were pretty much Jason we're talking about and no why oh oh boy you're like what you're doing right now is like dishonest I just explained the language that I would use yes yes we provoke them we took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative there's a difference provocative provoked yes the act of provoking stop lying okay it's getting too much okay let's move on we're gonna we're never gonna agree on the sax okay and I mean in the audience that nobody on this podcast is an expert on foreign policy sax is not Henry Kissinger you know I'm not Obama show you had come around to my point of view you said this war was a mistake on the very last show you said it was a disaster and now no I believe the West should present a united front and we should hold the line with Russia invading other countries that's my belief I do not think we should be doing this solo I think we should not be sending Biden we should be sending 15 liters of countries to Ukraine we should be sending people in and we should be doing a peace process and I think the military industrial complex largely driven by the GOP is what's at fault here they want to use these weapons they want to replenish the supply and they want to regime change I don't think we should be going for regime change I think we should be building bridges so my point is a little more subtle you're doing it right there you're basically engaging in this ridiculous rhetoric that we've seen in the media which is that if you simply want a more realistic American strategy because you believe it benefits America that you're automatically accused of not being a Putin sympathizer no you're doing what the mainstream media has done I just said to you it should be the entire West as a group as a block negotiating with Putin what do you think what do you think to be part of that I I welcome Xi Jinping Germany and the United States and France and the UK all getting together and trying to get these two parties to settle what do you think what do you think we're doing right or wrong with China right now yeah what do you think we're doing right and wrong or right wrong or I think we should be in discussions with them consistently I don't believe we should be isolating them I think we should be looking for areas we can collaborate on the environment technology you agree you agree with the chips act you agree with basically onshoring and you're showing all the critical infrastructure we need is that I think we should not be dependent on any foreign we should have energy security we should have uh methodology security technology of course yes but I think every country should I think China should have that we should have it every country should aspire to be resilient and not be dependent on another country and being dependent on a dictator like Germany was on Putin or we were with China for medicines or for you know medical equipment or chips we do not want to be in that position ever that's one question just on Ukraine just for a second Jay Cal would you be willing in order to achieve a peace deal for Ukraine would you be willing to agree to two things number one that Ukraine would be a neutral country instead of part of NATO and number two that we would recognize for Mia being part of Russia would you be willing to give those two things I think that's up not up to me I think it's up to the people of Ukraine and Russia to sort this out and it's up for the West to set the table for them to do it and part of setting the table for them to do it is to make it more painful for them to stay at this war so if they are told if you keep fighting over these things and you don't come to a resolution between those two parties who have to live with that resolution that is the uncomfortable thing that will force them and that could be China us and India all working together all of us working together to force those two parties into a solution
