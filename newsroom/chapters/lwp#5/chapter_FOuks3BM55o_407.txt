item one on the DACA today there is just a massive AI fomo frenzy going on economists publish a piece this week about the insane fundraising in the generative AI space this is stuff like Chachi BT stable diffusion you've heard these names and there are now 500 generative AI startups according to this report that tracks with what I'm seeing in the early stage and not counting the open AI 10 Billy from Microsoft investment donation rev share round trip whatever that is they have so far collectively raised more than 11 billion dollars the article included this chart uh which you can see if you're on our YouTube channel and just tons of folks working in audio image and text so we're basically looking at the multimedia basically revolution of PCS in the 90s occurring again and a complete platform platform shift Doug Leone from Sequoia one of the greatest investors in history of Silicon Valley had this to say and we will comment on the other side of this 50 second clip from Doug I actually think that AI is the next platform shift in the same way that mobile was the one before internet was the one before so I think AI is real but I said earlier we're going to overestimate it in a short term we're going to invest in everything in the same way that in 1999 we invested in everything but then Google came out of that or Facebook came out of that so I think you have to have a good head on your shoulder where you don't practice fomo where you don't chase every company AI is real AI is the next platform but how do we not invest in everything that walks how do we make certain Investments based on Market Maps based on thought processes that are more rational and not do every investment just because every other Venture firm is doing everything best all right shamath what do you think of this massive influx I think it's important to think about what the incentives are as Charlie Munger says show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome I posted it into our group chat Credit Suisse sent all their private banking customers an offer they are now offering 6.5 for a three-month t-bill 6.5 percent and if you go back to what we talked about before when the risk-free rate is somewhere north of five or five and a half percent and banks are willing to give you six and a half percent in the short term you have to generate more than three times that to make an investment make sense when you're investing in the long term so if three month money is going to pay you six and a half or seven if you're going to invest for 10 15 years which is what you need to do typically for a startup you need to get 20 to 25 percent so there's going to be a lot of pressure for Venture investors to put the money to work because otherwise they're LPS they're limited partners the people that give them the money will have this attitude that goes somewhere along the following lines okay I've committed to you why aren't you investing because otherwise I can get paid six and a half percent on the front end and so this is becoming very problematic what am I paying you for what am I paying you two percent a year in management fee for so I think what happens unfortunately is the opposite of what Doug says I think good investors will try to follow Doug's feedback and advice and the ones that have a track record of distributions of DPI can do more of it than not but I think most people will be under pressure to deploy the capital and so the 500 odd companies Jason you mentioned we'll get a lot of it and it'll get torched because most of them probably won't amount to much of anything in the short term you will create way too much correlation and you will have zero time diversity which as we've learned is a recipe for terrible returns time diversity being hey you deployed all this web 2 Capital web 3 Capital sorry crypto whatever in this very short period of time you overpaid Brad uh when you hear chamoth talk about the 6.5 and then you look at private markets you uh invest across the life cycle of companies obviously you're in some private companies we all know very well famously snowflake I think your biggest win ever correct me if I'm wrong uh in terms of a private how do you look at this when you're a steward of capital public markets private markets and then just YOLO just put it into you know some T bells or yeah bonds or whatever I mean first let's just frame right the chart that you showed I think you should it said you know X open AI I don't know something like 10 or 11 billion dollars have has been invested into some 500 AI companies I mean I happen to agree with Doug that this is a platform shift on the same magnitude as the internet or mobile itself in fact it may be bigger than both of those but you know when I look at 10 or 11 billion dollars you know let's put it in context meta is going to spend 20 billion in one year alone on AR VR and this is on an entire platform so I I don't know I I I I think whenever you have something as tectonic as mobile or Internet it deserves a lot of investment and yes it's going to be messy and yes chamat's right the cost of capital frankly is limiting the amount of money going into these businesses already so we see a lot of dry powder sitting on the sideline that's chasing new ideas I think one way one way to frame it as well is to think about in 2000 we all knew that the internet was going to be big we may have been lucky enough to conclude that search was going to be big but if you invest in in Yahoo or info seat or AOL or excitement you tore all that money went to zero right so now think about just these large language models right the foundation models which are driving and enabling all of it open AI you've got open AI you gotta drop it you got cohere you've got character you got stability you've got Lambda it is almost impossible to know within the certainty much like it was with the search engines in 99 2000 who's going to emerge where the value capture is going to be it may all end up with Microsoft and Google I mean this may end up looking like IOS and Android at the foundation model level and so you know I think as investors for example on the foundation model side I think it's very difficult to choose just one particularly with the largest one is frankly captive and a proxy to Microsoft and they're capping your upside return so like those are difficult investment decisions that doesn't detract from the fact that I think it is as big as Doug suggests and I do think they're going to be applications and tooling layer to come out of this that's going to produce really big Winners I would say that we are spending an extraordinary amount of time in the space we haven't made a lot of Investments I think you have to study you have to get deep I mean certainly and I have been investing in this space for at least a decade maybe 15 years but don't underestimate that the Transformer model really did change the game here and we're now producing impacts much larger sax uh last week you said we'll have three and crypto didn't kind of stick with you you didn't see the use cases and you in the first inning here or first at bat you rattled off three or four really compelling use cases from summaries to you know the the assistant uh guide on your side concept is this Akin in your mind because Brad just said it could be bigger than mobile internet mobile AI Revolution if you were to look at those three do you think it's bigger than actually mobile and then we'll get into return profiles of 6.5 on cash versus whatever VC is going to be able to do in this kind of Market yeah I mean so I agree with Brad and and Doug that this is the next big platform shift whether it's as big as mobile or it's more like social or Cloud I mean those have been the big platform shifts over the last decade or two and I think this is definitely on par with those I think Brad's right we don't know where the value capture is going to be maybe it just all ends up accreting to the big companies who can make massive investments in this space you know one difference between the internet ecosystem today and 20 years ago is you do have these giant companies who are not totally incompetent right I mean they are they do have lots of talents and engineers and you know like 20 years ago you'd have company you know the big companies would just sit on their hands in the face of a platform shift and then just be seeing Ducks who get disrupted that's not going to happen today that being said I do think that any new platform shifts creates opportunities for startups and it may not be efficient the way that these opportunities get pursued in the sense that yeah Doug's right that this will be a lot of spray and pray but I think that it is kind of efficient for the ecosystem as a whole right because like any smart engineer with a half decent idea ends up getting funded and out of all of that you get kind of a pre-cambrian explosion where you know the ecosystem evolves a lot of different types of businesses most of them don't work they get wiped out they go extinct but there'll be some good things that get funded so we're more like I think Doug and how we see it we don't want to spray and pray one be very selective we want to put more money behind fewer opportunities that we think are are better and Doug Leone you know I think he generally gives good advice of the tough love variety and this is of a piece with that and so I I agree with him that being said there is a certain value to the ecosystem and having all these seed funds to spray and pray right because this gets a lot it plants a lot of flowers and then you see what blooms I would say yeah to build on that sax this is a perfect inefficiency you know when you see it from the outside you're like well this is super inefficient why so many companies if you free your mind and just say their experiments two or three person experiments 500k to a million and a half in that first stage when I invest right before you do when you do your series a is at five or ten million Milestone based funding is back in the tech industry and that was something chemath that we lost for a little while there people would just come out and they would raise a series B out of the gate no product Market fit et cetera now what we're seeing is people are raising that 12 to 18 months they got their backs up against the wall speaking of tough love which you reference acts that tough love of hey you have to hit the next Milestone what did you accomplish with the 1.5 million in order to get the 10 million in order to get the 30 million that 500 is going to go 10x they'll be 5 000 of these startups but it'll quickly Whittle down winner chamata's people go through this Milestone based funding system in Silicon Valley we haven't given enough time for a logical framework of investing to develop which also is tied to a logical framework for entrepreneurship to emerge we're just way way way too early so the thing with all of these language models is that they are Grist for the mill and we talked about this before if it was a highly proprietary asset you would have never sold 49 of it to Microsoft for 10 billion dollars because you would assume that it was worth a trillion dollars so it's a huge tell on the part of open AI their deep understanding and they understand it better than anybody else that it's a bit of a capped upside so what is uncapped I guess is maybe the better question well if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush as an example the people panning for gold in my opinion are the people building language models today they're going to come and they're going to go but who's going to win well the pick and shovel providers won Levi Strauss one so what is the equivalent of that today I think it's at the Silicon layer because you need to really re-architect how compute will actually work in a world of all of these models those folks will get paid if you look at AMD and Nvidia they've been getting paid for years they continue to get paid they probably will continue to get paid even more and so folks that actually take a step into doing something hard and difficult in AI like custom silicon could get rewarded and then there's what I call the white truffles what are these unique Alba white truffles these singular sources of data that when used in reinforcement learning make your output just zing and that's where I think Facebook is an obvious white truffle Cora is a white truffle but there are a lot of startups that could become white truffles if they gather enough data and that's like a pretty reasonable framework and so in that framework if you apply to today there's way few silicon startups and there's way few white truffles instead it's everything is the bologna in the middle which is random people talking about some random model that's just gonna again become highly commoditized you have to remember all these models are open source and none of them mean anything in the absence of the data you give it to train on 100 Brad hey okay well I want to add one other piece of news that we saw this week which is open AI announced that it's developer AI they were cutting the tax on that or basically the metered rate they charge to use it by 90 percent so I think this is going to be a game changer I think this is based on the chat GPT 3.5 API and of course they're coming out with 4.0 later this year I've already had explained to the audience what an API is and why this is important for those people who don't know just application programming interface it allows a developer of some other application to build on top of you so in other words like a developer wouldn't have to use this chat interface to get access to the large language model you could just submit your request through the API and so give an example of what of like a popular app and how they might use it yeah API so I think like notion actually had a demo that they published where incredible it was a pretty incredible demo maybe we can find it and it would do things they added actions in the demo like generate a task list so you could take like a document or a meeting summary and would spit out recommendations for next steps or tasks it could you know spit out a table basically it's the autocomplete for everything that we talked about right so now notion doesn't need to build their own llm expertise they just don't use the API and then the notion app you say hey I'm building a marketing plan and you say well okay give me a list of things that should be on my marketing plan for my new app it sends a signal to the chat GPT API which will be on Azure Microsoft's platform and then it gives you the data back you don't have to build the language model yeah incredibly powerful notion has all the content that they need but they don't have the AI expertise so now they don't have to generate your or create AI expertise in-house they just use the API it's really powerful and but just to finish the thought here I

    "Title": "The AI Frenzy and Investment Pressure in Startups", 
    "Summary": "In this video, the speakers discuss the recent massive fundraising and investment happening in generative AI startups. They talks about the comment of Doug Leone from Sequoia, who believes AI is the next platform shift in the same way that mobile and internet was before. However, they also discuss the pressures of investing in these startups, with Chamath pointing out the high pressure to deploy capital and the low expected returns for most companies. Brad believes that while the investment is massive, it is still low compared to the investment for an entire platform like Meta's AR VR platform. There is a need to invest in AI but it needs to be done with caution and thoughtfulness."
