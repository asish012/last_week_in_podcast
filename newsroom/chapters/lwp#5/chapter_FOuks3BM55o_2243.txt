you're referencing Salesforce so we'll pivot to that I'm joking uh it's not that bad uh but I think this is a good time to maybe talk about the public markets and inflation and what we're seeing in macro so can I set up a question for Brad actually sure go ahead yes yes so so on a previous podcast I laid out my theory of how you could just use the two-year bond rate relative to the FED funds rate to understand where the bond markets sort of prediction Market about inflation is going and a month ago the the two-year bond rate was at 4.1 percent relative to 4.5 percent fed funds rates in other words the bond market was betting that interest rates would go down between now and two years from now relative to where the FED had it so therefore it believed that inflation had been conquered now fast forward just one month later and the two-year bond rate said about 4.9 percent you know the FED funds rates about four and a half percent that is a massive swing basically 80 basis points swing in the I guess the tier bond rate and so the market seemed to be saying all of a sudden not just that they expect rates to be higher longer but also that the FED needs to keep raising and that is a big change so Brad what is the basis for that and what do we now believe about inflation I think just a few weeks ago we were thinking that this problem was licked and the market took off like a rocket it ripped now all of a sudden it seems like investors are really worried that inflation is not over so where does this stand right now well I think when we started the year you know the the tenure was close to 3-2 we're now we're closer to four percent the 10 minus 2 is is negative as it's been in the last uh probably 10 years so the market is clearly saying you know we saw some inflation prints that came in hotter I think it's now consensus which you guys have been saying on the Pod that you know although the second derivative is slowing that we're it's sticky right we're going to get stock at this four or four and a half three and a half and it's the slope of the curve down where it is going to be slower um we've gone from thinking we're going to have 225s to now thinking we'll have three or four you know and so I think everybody is now bracing for more inflation but remember when we started here on January 1st the consensus wisdom was we were going to retest the s p at 3200 we're going to have an earnings recession and that inflation was going to continue to run hotter the only surprise in my mind so far this year is how well the equity markets have held up in the face of a tenure that's gone parabolic right and a natural earnings recession right and you you know you you posted you know in our Thread shamath about just quality of earnings you know even the earning speeds are pretty low quality and so I think you know we now are going to have a couple inflation prints coming up over the course of the next couple weeks that are going to be important my hunch is you know everybody has tilted again on you know what we saw in the last couple prints my suspicion if you look at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs the consensus view is that we're still heading in the direction of four percent faster than I think people emotionally think so I would say there's maximum uncertainty in the world the fear that inflation is uncapped the way Larry Summers was articulate in November and December is less today than it was but what's emerged is this idea that we're going to have higher rates for longer and we're going to have higher inflation for longer now the the question I'd throw back at you is the market abhors uncertainty the Market's done totally fine during periods where we had three percent inflation and five and a half percent rates right when when the internet boom that was you know 2000 to 2005 rates were a hell of a lot higher than the rates are today so I don't think that higher rates and higher inflation means that we can't you know invest in venture-backed companies that have huge secular growth the world doesn't end but what I do think it means is like if there's massive uncertainty in the world if allocators of capital don't know whether rates are going to double again whether inflation is going to double again then everything just shuts down and that's really bad for the economy I don't see that happening right now but I do think that the prince over the course of the next eight weeks are going to be important Tremonti have any macro that's here at the same time this is happening we saw rents broke in the last month so rents got cheaper yeah a governing principle I think I probably said it too many times but I'll say it again rates are going to be higher than we like and they'll stay here longer than we want so if you use that as a principal whenever the consensus thinks we're done it's been pretty profitable to be on the other side of consensus and so I still kind of maintain that we're probably going to have a five and a half percent fed funds rate which means that I don't know maybe Credit Suisse will offer me seven and a half percent soon on three month T bills but we're going to have higher rates and I do think Brad's right though in the sense that as long as we know that then that's it and we can forecast it into the future without it changing too much it'll be okay but right now what you're seeing is a lot of Make-Believe going on in in the stock market so Nick if you want to just throw up that image so this is a really this is the chart of uh Cash Flow versus earnings yeah so this is something that I saw in Bloomberg which I thought was really interesting and if you focus on the period of 2020 to 2024 what you see is the white line which is net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the blue line is cash flows from operation so what does that mean and this is for uh S P 500 firms this is the best 500 companies in the world yeah and the white line is what you tell Wall Street in terms of what you make on paper the blue line is what actually appears in the bank account so why could there be a gap between what you tell somebody you made I made a dollar versus what's in the bank 50 cents well the reason is that there's all kinds of accounting tricks that you can use accruals inventories and all of these things allow you to present a healthier earnings report than is actually true and so right now we have the worst earning situation so the worst Gap between what we are telling people versus what is actually in the bank account that we've had for 30 years since 1990. and so it just brings into Focus the fact that we may be in the last few innings of trying to make sure this all looks okay in which case one faction of the investing world who thinks that this earnings recession is actually at hand would be kind of right and then what they would say is that once we all realize that these earnings are fake and you reset down 15 that's where you get to the mid 3000 in in the S P 500 right now it's around four thousand I don't know if that's true or not but there's more and more evidence that would support that the way that they see the world could be credible the other side says Hey listen this is a bump in the road we're getting a handle on things and it's stabilizing so even though it's higher than we'd like it's not going to change that much so now just think about 10 15 years from now and let's go and those are the folks that want to rip the money into growth stocks and tech stocks again how does the consumer play into all this record low unemployment like it's one percent in Utah three and a half percent for the country two and a half jobs for every American who's unemployed and then these rents coming down but consumers have seemed to have burned off all that extra money they had so Brad when you look at the consumer-driven economy that the world lives in that's not true because you have to understand stimulus is still entering the economy it's just harder to measure so for example take Social Security you have cost of living adjustments in Social Security that's lifting payments by 10 and 15 percent because it's backdated for what was going on last year and remember last year we had two three four five percent inflation rates so there is more and more money coming into people's pockets that we don't realize and we're all on the hook for that as U.S taxpayers so I think it's very dangerous to kind of look at one data point and try to pick off what's happening in consumer land because there's all kinds of hidden ways in which money gets back to people Brad you have thoughts on the consumer because you know I test it does seem like consumers are still spending money but the cost of goods in some cases is coming down I mean how do you look at the consumer and try to make sense of what's going on here because it does seem the United States is in its own little bubble here world of just over employment still even though we're seeing these layoffs in town well I would say number one uh that the pop we've seen in rates which impacts consumers by way of higher mortgages higher variable expenses on their credit cards was offset over the last few months by lower energy costs so their cost of gasoline went down add in the things that chamat's talking about and I'm not sure you took a lot of money out of people's pockets I would say this that again what we're talking about here retail sales have continued to do really well e-commerce sales in January were quite strong that would all be consistent with this off Landing but here we are you know again talking about macro I think when you spend this much time talking about macro doing what we do you know like last year I'll be the first to raise my hand and say you know like our friend Bill Gurley would say it leads you in the wrong direction the fact that the matter is it's totally unknown and unknowable where we're going to go over the course of the next three or four months I think there's a better ability to predict maybe over the course of the next couple years um but the fact is if you would have told any I was just with a bunch of uh investors you probably represent a trillion dollars of public market demand 10 uh or so long only investors if you would have told any of them that the tenure was going to be at 396 they would have told you that the NASDAQ would be down 10 to start the year and it did just the opposite so I think you got it you know you're you have a much better chance particularly if you're playing at home right than trying to to guess the direction of that find five companies that you think are going to grow uh and earn more money irrespective of the direction of rates and inflation own those and enjoy your life I'm looking at the world and going sax my Lord I'm seeing great Founders great companies and five to ten million dollar valuations and I can buy five ten fifteen percent of these companies uh this feels like the best uh it's been for me as an angel investor seed investor or seed fund for a long time this is fantastic uh great deal flow the deals are taking six weeks to close we're having very thoughtful discussions people are taking a real focused approach to how they deploy the capital it is not YOLO people are building models again people are showing their CAC they're being thoughtful about how they spend the money they're being thoughtful about salaries and hiring so what what's your you seem to think that you know what we're seeing here is challenging or a problem what are your thoughts on how it's affecting your day-to-day business as somebody who's a company Builder well let's separate two things so there's the tech ecosystem and then there's the economy as a whole the fact of the matter is that Tech already had its bubble in 2021 it had its crash in 2022 and now we're largely on the other side of that there's still a lot of companies like we talked about that are going to need to restructure who raised during the bubble and may not have come to grips with that but if you're talking about new investment new rounds new companies are starting with a clean sheet of paper and a blank slate you're right things seem good and normal right people are making intelligent Investments and obviously the Innovation cycle doesn't have anything to do with the macro picture I mean technology wants to evolve and it's great engineers and product people who drive those ideas forward and they're not thinking about interest rates I never thought about the FED funds rate at all when I was a Founder Running Company so let's just put that aside and acknowledge that great Innovation is going to keep happening no matter what the macroeconomic picture looks like that being said I mean just for the you know listeners of the show who aren't startup Founders I tend to be a little bit gloomy about the macro picture right now because yeah it's true that what Brad said that we've had good economies with five percent rates before but I think you also have to look at the pace of change or the rate at which the the FED funds rate has been going up and if you look at the chart of rate increases it is a very steep chart of rate increases and I just think that for the last decade or so we've been operating in this like zero interest rate or Reserve environment with loss of monetary stimulus and I think a lot of companies a lot of parts of the economy got addicted to that stimulus they got hooked on drugs now all of a sudden you're putting them through withdrawal very very quickly and obviously the withdrawal pangs are going to be worse if you can't taper off slowly so it looked like just a few weeks ago that the Fed was done raising rates now we know that they're not we don't really know when they're going to stop so I tend to be a little bit gloomy with respect to the the big macro picture because I just don't see how you can change rates this fast and I mean you look at like real estate for example we just saw the first year over year decrease in the housing market in a while and again that's all driven by rates the cost of mortgages going up and two big defaults in the first two big defaults yeah so I I think that there's going to be some pain ahead now you know ironically from the standpoint of the tech ecosystem we may have already taken our medicine and we may already be on the other side actually that is a good way to to look at as we took the medicine it's painful and here Jason maybe maybe that's the segue

    "Title":"Market Response to Inflation Expectations",
    "Summary":"They discuss the market's response to inflation expectations, as seen in the two-year bond rate relative to the fed funds rate, which has undergone an 80 basis point swing in just a month. The market is betting that interest rates will go down relative to where the Fed had it, which indicated that inflation had been conquered. However, investors are now worried that inflation is not over. The consensus now is that although the second derivative is slowing, inflation is sticky, and the market is bracing for more inflation. The fear that inflation is uncapped is less today than it was, but there is maximum uncertainty in the world. Higher rates and higher inflation do not mean that venture-backed companies cannot be invested in, but massive uncertainty could lead to everything shutting down, which would be terrible for the economy. Finally, the discussion ends with the idea that rates are going to be higher than we like and they'll stay here longer than we want."
