to uh talking about benioff I would say we haven't took it we're taking it we're starting to take our medicine well that makes sense that Benny off with his you know very loving family kind of approach to running the company might actually it might take them a little while to become a bit Cutthroat so as everybody knows Benny off and Salesforce have had a lot of turnover a lot of senior Executives have left voluntary or involuntary but shares were up 11 on Thursday after reporting their Q4 earnings they're up 14 year over year small net loss but the company bought back 2.3 billion dollars worth of its stock we're going to see more of that for sure and they're going to be increasing its share buyback program to 20 billion dollars going forward and like meta which suddenly got fit and got religion benioff is now basically with all these activists I guess on on his ass he says uh and this is the quote from the earnings call we're more closely scrutinizing every dollar of investment in resource and very focused on driving operational excellence and automation across our business focusing on 4K eras stronger moves expense for structuring employee productivity uh there it is product Innovation and building relationships with shareholders profitability is are truly our number one strategy and that's my number one strategy that's the number one thing we talked about at the start of every meeting we have in this company quite a turnaround your thoughts Brad I don't think the story is that you know that benioff you know made these cuts and that activists are around the rim what was significant was his comments uh that he made and I tweeted about it today you know he said every CEO in Silicon Valley has looked at what Elon Musk has done and asked themselves do they need to unleash their own Elon within them and you know listen we've been talking about this for nine months the reality is if you look at the employee count at Salesforce in 2015 they had 19 000 employees as of last year they had 80 000. in seven years they 4X the number of employees they were a mature Company by 2015 their employees catered at 23 percent you know we don't talk about it in this way but these large companies these employee bases they're not unions but they may as well be there is during this Age of Excess where it was just easy for people to hire more people and build more things not to make tough choices Etc right we just had an explosion like we've never seen in Silicon Valley in the number of employees in these businesses Meadow went from 10 000 to 80 85 000 Google went to 185 000 and at those levels it's very difficult to govern them and when the CEOs went to make decisions into businesses there would be protests revolts within the business 30 or 40 000 people with scientific back to the office no we're not going to work three days a week no you can't name our AI bot uh what you want to name it because it offends us and so to me what's more significant is over the last six months we've seen courage gain momentum in Silicon Valley right what's deeply under-appreciated about meta and the changes they made it would be one thing if it was just window dressing we cut 10 percent of the workforce kind of tighten our belt a little bit but Zuckerberg got on his call and he said we only have two priorities in 2023. one is efficiency and he went into depth about once they started cutting people how the company got faster the product release cycle sped up the employees got happier and now it's an end in itself to delayer the business that's what we're hearing out of benioff as well and I think it's you know people can quibble with how Elon went about the change which you and you and uh David are very familiar with at Twitter but the reality is he lit a fuse in Silicon Valley that is giving courage whether it's private companies series B companies pre-ipo companies public companies I've had that conversation more times uh than you can imagine over the course of the last six months and I think it's a really important change because I think it breathes new productivity into all these businesses and importantly it unleashes these Engineers back into the ecosystem to start the next wave of companies yeah so Jason I mean you and I got to tag along with Elon during that transition phase at Twitter and the thing that I took away from it was just how much agency you know CEOs have that they're not using I mean Elon went in there and he basically changed whatever he saw that he didn't like I mean unsentimentally and quickly and you know and so you look at all these other companies you talk to CEOs sometimes and they act like they're prisoners of their companies like I can't change this I can't change Stockholm syndrome yeah yeah it's like you know I've got all these employees and all these layers and but I can't you know there's always some reason I'm afraid of the bad PR or you know whatever it is and I you know the thing I came away realizing is just how much agency particularly founder CEOs have that they just don't use you know they're always like hemming and hawing and ringing their hands and acting like they're tied down by this or that and the reality is they can do whatever they want just about um you know within the bounds of what's what's legal and and I think they're starting to realize oh wait a second like I actually can do that you know I can walk into my company one day and if there's a team that's not performing that's giving me answers that don't make any sense I could start over wait I'm just going to start over yeah I mean if you can't get it done then we need to have somebody who can do it and it's it's incredible like we were doing an analysis on this week in startups of the you know employees per company and the revenue per employee per head count and I got roasted for having this com even having this conversation and now here we are chamoth people are looking at efficiency we're looking at you know really uh how efficient can these companies uh be run is there a limit to where this is going and and if we were to look at this as a process where are the Fangs the Amazons the Googles Facebooks where are they at in terms of percentage to being at Elon if you if you were to put Twitter and Elon as the the goal where are these companies and I don't know that that is the goal maybe maybe he's cut too much who knows we'll find out I think it's a it's a it's a pretty radical experiment he's doing there yeah yeah I don't think that's a reasonable or an achievable goal for a public company okay I mean I think the thing we have to keep in mind is elon's also capable of doing that because he paid 44 billion dollars of his own money to buy something that he owns alt right that no longer has Revenue pressure to outside stakeholders different circumstance Revenue went down 70 at Twitter well that only affects him and and his ability to pay whatever he borrowed in order to buy that company and as long as he's willing to fund that somehow he's literally allowed to do whatever he wants that's no longer the case when you're borrowing money from other people to build your business which is what every other Capital Market participant does public market participant does and private Market participants so I think that that distinction is just a little bit important because it probably means that there is a shadow of what Elon is doing that's probably the threshold of what's possible and it's probably you know sort of 50 percent head count reduction that's probably the the Bound in which things break because I think the thing to keep in mind is that over time this stuff is like collagen in the body it's just like it creates these interconnected webs of just very difficult stuff that you send you that you cannot tease apart so even if you try to go in and cut 50 of a company like Facebook or Google or Microsoft or apple or Amazon it would be so difficult because all of a sudden the coordination that happens at that scale I think would get lost so I'm not sure if it's possible you kind of have to do what they're doing which is cut five percent then cut ten percent then cut five percent then cut five percent and I know it frustrates people on the outside looking in but I think it's the it's probably the only way it can be done without torpedoing the company what does that do on a culture basis then because that is the big critique hey you're creating now this culture of fear I guess the opposite of that is your grand and culture of performance and expectation so how do you think about it on a culture basis because that keeps coming up from Founders to David's point it depends because I think companies when they're smaller I mean I can tell you when I was a part of the Facebook senior management team we would rank all the employees so we had a very good sense of who was the best and the most performant all the way down to who was not and we were able to do that probably up to two or three thousand employees that's not possible at fifty thousand and nor is it fair so because you don't know who these folks are the real contributors are you have to do what Elon did which is literally go person to person and say who is unbelievably performant or critical yeah in the absence of doing that you just don't know who to let go and so you have no choice except to bleed down the question that I have and Brad maybe there's a smart analyst on your team that can do it is right and it's more of a statement as well can you imagine the totality of stock based comp that's been given out by all these companies since 2015 when they were catering their employee bases by 25 a year I bet you it's a trillion and a half dollars at least you think it's that you think it's in that order magnitude 100 this has been the greatest grift in the history of Silicon Valley for sure let's pause for a second can you explain what we're talking about here stock based compensation obviously is the stock given to employees it's generally not counted well let's do it right let's do it this way let's just say that you believe in capitalism okay yep so if you if you believe in capitalism let's say the the four of us start a company and there's a dollar of profit and we each own 25 of the company got it normally what you would say is each of us get 25 cents right reasonable we own 25 each there's a dollar profit we each have 20. so that means that in four years right we each will have made a dollar because so let's just say it cost a dollar to get off the ground or four dollars to get off the ground all in Summit budget We believe We all would have been made whole we all would feel great and then now every year afterwards that 25 cents we get is profit now let's say that Jason you add a fifth person and Brad and David and I can't say anything about it okay and that fifth person now gets a fifth of it right and so now all of a sudden our 25 cents goes down to 20 cents then let's say you add five more people now all of a sudden our 25 cents went to 20. and then it went to 10 10. yeah and at some point Brad and David and I raise our hand and say hey this is not the deal we signed up for and you say well too bad because Revenue would not be what it is and profits would not be what it is without these extra six people and that's effectively what everybody debates when they own a stock the shareholders want that number to be as small as possible and I think what Brad is observing is that in Silicon Valley what has happened is there's been poor accountability for what all of those extra people do and profits haven't written risen fast enough to make the existing three people on the cap table feel okay about it and that instead of talking about three people and six and a dollar you're talking about trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of extra shareholders I know we have some charts here so we can do some fun with numbers I think taking a step back I think it's very important to realize that stock as a form of compensation to create alignment excitement in the early stage of venture capital is part of the true magic of Silicon Valley you know you're starting a company you ask somebody to go on this adventure take a bunch of risk they often have to cut their pay they could get at Google by half to join your adventure it's only fair that you give them stock in the company and they share in the ups and if the company smokes it uh they get rich for taking that incremental risk on their behalf and on their family's behalf what's happened over the last 15 years is something totally different which is this stock as a form of early stage compensation right continued and there's a feature in Silicon Valley as companies came public one way to kind of hide an expense in a business is to bury it in SBC so let's say Google wanted to hire somebody for four million dollars which they're doing today in AI but instead of paying them 4 million in cash which would all count against their operating profit they give them 500 000 in cash and three and a half million dollars in stock and let's say they make all that stock vegetable immediately Jason in this year it's obvious to you and I that's just cash the person turns around and sells it it's a real expense of the business real expense to the shareholders but when they report their earnings and they report adjusted ebitda they adjust out the three and a half million dollars that they gave by way of SBC why did stock based comp SBC get excluded from accounting what is the history of that and is that going to change now are people going to say and shareholders demand in this new economy in this new you know sort of reality hey you know what you can't play fun with numbers here stock base comp has to come out what would you like to see Brad it's fairly esoteric but they're back in the mid 2000s 2004 2005 there was a and a county there's a big debate about this Warren Buffett was famously saying listen it doesn't matter whether you pay in stock whether you're paying cash whether you're paying cans of beers like it all costs the same he's right and so there was a debate we had a statement an accounting statement fasbi 123 and in that statement it said Gap ebitda must include the cost a stock uh based compensation so all of a sudden if I'm reporting Gap ebitda I got to include the cost of stock comp which it does today but what but but but what did everybody do but what happened they started adjusting it out right because they said hey this is a real expense right because we're not it's not cash we're giving out what are they solid do they come up with a term for this adjustments the crime here is that when rates fell to zero and everybody was making money on tech stocks nobody wanted to rock this boat and everybody just said you know like adjustedy but uh kind of ignored I can I can model it into my future dilution so we Model A Share account uh over the course of the next three years but this literally over the last five years went parabolic because I just shared with you the number of employees exploded the amount of share-based compensation exploded because of competition for those employees coinbase I think just reported SBC which hold your hat sax was 70 of Revenue not 70 of their earnings 70 of their revenue just for coinbase we're talking about here that's for coinbase and so you know last week there was something that I thought was pretty brave booking.com on their earnings call really called this out and what they said is listen we've been playing by the rules we understand that stock based comp is cash and they say every every metric we report includes the impact of stock based compensation and if you look over the last 15 years if I'm an owner of booking.com I was only deluded by about five percent if I was an owner of Salesforce or Expedia I was deluded by about 25 percent that's 25 of percent of my ups were given away right but yet those things were adjusted out when they reported earnings and so you know what's become in Vogue today is CFOs get on their calls and they say no no no don't worry we're gonna buy back a lot of shares so we won't have much dilution okay but if you take my two billion of profits that jamacha's talked about and it goes right out the door just to buy back the shares you just issued you're effectively round tripping that money then it just proves the point it's cash it's an expense to shareholders and my biggest problem with it is it's led to the bloat because if companies actually had to account for this as cash they wouldn't hire as many people they wouldn't pay as much in stock comp and I'll end with this because I want to end with a solution every comp committee on every board frankly their heads spin when you start talking about this subject they bring in a comp consultant and the comp consultant they is really the cya for the comp committee because they want to approve a comp plan that's been recommended by the management team and they just want to know is this what everybody else is doing okay so everybody's doing it so the comp consultant looks around and says yeah all your peers are doing this this is why Charlie Munger said I'd rather throw a pit viper down the front of my shirt than hire a comp consultant right what is going on on these comp committees if you give bonuses to anybody in your business that are that is based on an adjusted ebitometric rather than free cash flow per share per share is the key here it's negligence it's negligence so if comp committees just walk in and they say the gold standard as a public company is 50 basis points annual dilution that's Apple that's booking.com Visa Mastercard or even below that that's the gold standard once you're in the public market and we will never instead of is our employ our employees on the basis of anything that excludes .com and it has to be on a per share basis that would be a massive Leap Forward for public company account seems reasonable anybody have any other thoughts on that stock base comp no all
