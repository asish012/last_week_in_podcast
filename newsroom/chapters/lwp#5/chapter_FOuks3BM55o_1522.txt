you have your finger on the pulse of LPS uh limited partners who back funds like Jamal's sax is mine and yours we heard 6.5 on your money for no risk well you in tremont's position is hey you have to Triple that if you want to be a private Market investor that's about 20 20 Rule of 72 that means every three and a half years you got to double if you're doing that for a 10-year fund you're looking at a 5x fund because kind of table Stakes then I think just back in the envelope math what are LPS thinking right now are they looking at this world and saying I should just be all in cash or are they saying yeah everybody thinks we should be all being cash therefore there's not going to be enough money in private therefore there's an opportunity there we know the 6.5 rate you know that's not going to be here forever it may be here for a little while but we need to we need to keep investing in Venture uh or are they just Cutthroat about it like let's pause Venture investing private Market investing uh it's a it's a great question first when I look at the three-year treasury bill it's like 4.7 not to quibble here so I think Chamas getting a little goozy Goosey on the 6.5 but the the fact of the matter is what does that means you're super special your VIP maybe there's like some sort of like uh bond rate that included corporates or something maybe it was I'm getting my 5.2 from Robin Hood on my Robinhood account for Jay training so it's right what is in that what is in that Jason they probably got some junk bonds and they're ripping you off whatever whatever it is I'm getting Five Points until you're not you are until you're not it's a 100 t-built parentheses and junk bond funds look at the fine print Jacob uh LPS have a 10-year View they understand like most people I mean listen if you look out at the tenure the reason the tenure is you know that we have real interest rates at about one and a half percent so that's the 10-year less expected inflation when you look out is because it people expect inflation to come down and they expect rates to come down so if you were an LP and you said I'm not going to invest in Venture and the next two vintages which may be the best two vintages we've seen in a long time because prices are adjusting Etc and I'm going to move it all into some rate bet first it's just very difficult to do they don't move their allocations around that quickly now a wealthy family as an LP could move their allocations around really quickly but if you're Texas or you're Ohio or you're a sovereign wealth fund you're betting on the Arc of value creation I would say this the consequence is they're narrowing their aperture as to the Venture funds they want to allocate capital okay explain that unpack who they are narrowing the aperture term two we've talked a lot on this pod about uh the power law and the truth of the matter is whether we're talking about AI or software or anything else that you know people are are going to be funding it's 10 of the Investments that are going to yield 90 percent of the returns and so they're looking at that and saying who are the top 10 firms in Silicon Valley I either want to get allocation to those firms who are seeing the best deals converting the best deals and are selective like Saks talked about or we just don't want to allocate and so I think you know what we saw over the last two years Jason was an explosion of new funds an explosion of new uh you know first time second time funds I think subscale small funds with no DPI uh they're going to find a really really tough time to Chamas point about DPI raising capital and you're going to see the scale player scale so part of that uh is clearing out the inventory from the last cycle two new stories this week about companies you know maybe struggling Sequoia got off the board of Citizen if you don't know citizen that's that app that tells you where crimes are happening in your city very popular in San Francisco uh it's literally goes off every 90 seconds it's pretty dystopian that company citizen which is a pretty cool app uh has raised 130 million today Sequoia led the series a in 2017. uh they did a pay to play around if you don't know what that is um basically if you don't invest you get crammed down how does the cram down work well your shares in the company went down ten to one and you probably got moved to uh common shares as opposed to as opposed to Preferred which has a series of protections they get their money out first yada yada but Sequoia refused to participate according to this ft story again Sequoia did not comment on this it's it's kind of something you don't do as a VEC when something goes bad at a company and you leave the board you generally don't want to say uh bad things or taint the company uh any more than leaving the board does so a bunch of cram Downs happening and then dovetailing with that instacart according to the Wall Street Journal had a big Q4 As It prepares to go public instacart if you remember we talked about it on the show cut its internal evaluation 75 percent last year from 39 billion to 10 billion according to sources instacart's Q4 results uh according to the Wall Street Journal up more than 50 even though order volume grew only 16 percent why they turned advertising on the app just like uber and Amazon a lot of these Commerce folks folks are building add business inside of theirs so what do you think about what's happening as we clear out this private anybody have thoughts on instacart or the cram down rounds go either way with this and then we'll go to I wouldn't Focus too much on those two companies I think we're going to see in the second half of 23 and all of 24 is a lot of medicine being taken a lot of down rounds a lot of structure is going to be A Tale of Two Cities the hot area you know AI is going to continue to receive new investment and all these companies that you know that receive peak valuations in 2021 are gonna have a Day of Reckoning either you know if they're lucky maybe they have a flat round or modestly up round but a lot of them are going to have down rounds or restructurings and this is going to be going on for the next year and a half what's your philosophy Saxon leaving a board this is a really dicey issue when you give up on a company what's the best practice there how do you do it without damaging the company obviously the founder relationship is going to be hard what have you learned about this as a private Market investor well I think I think that sometimes we like flip uh board members internally at craft just because people have different amounts of capacity that's not a statement at all about the way craft feels about the company it's just a reflection of our individual bandwidth or whose expertise are needed at that time but when the firm itself quits a board I think there's no way to read that of and you know a statement of protest and I don't know what happened with that company but it seems to me that you know again it could be a sign that the Venture firm isn't happy with the way that they're being treated the cram down uh Chama that's that's a bitter pill to swallow why would Founders do this cram down instead of just adding a little more to the top and is there a way to do this without you know going scorched Earth or poisoning the well as it were we I mean again putting this app and Sequoia aside this is happening all over the ecosystem so is there a way to do this gracefully or is it just going to be messy I think it's going to be really messy I mean to State the obvious no no Venture Capital investor ever quits the board voluntarily of a great company that's doing well that would be dumb so as David said sort of like the proof is in the pudding there and at the same time there are a lot of in companies who don't want to see the writing on the wall and we'll do all kinds of gymnastics to try to stick a landing on a contorted financing and sometimes those things have real consequences to other investors who just don't think it's the right thing to do I wouldn't read too much into this except that good Founders have a responsibility to do what's right for themselves and their employees nobody else and the thing to keep in mind not the investors really no and I think you I think you absolutely have to prioritize the people doing the actual work and if and if you actually did prioritize them what you would probably say to yourself is oh my gosh there are people who I work with who I look in the eye every day because investors you'll see once a quarter but I have my fellow employees as a Founder that I look in the eyes every day who've been toiling with me for umpteen hours a day every day for years and they are now totally underwater what is the right thing to do for them and I think if you just answer that question you wouldn't do all these contorted things you would just reset the valuation you would refresh the equity pool you would issue options back out to those employees and you would move on it's all these other things that get in the way of answering that simple simple question where people it up I've and I've done that before you sex if you don't have a team and you don't have a motivated team you have nothing I've done that before I don't want to rehash one of my more miserable experiences but I was dealing with a company that had a grossly inflated evaluation it was a total problem case we voluntarily slashed the valuation in half and reissued options to the employees to keep him motivated no big deal yeah yeah exactly and it's not that it's no big deal but it requires some amount of fortitude and like you know understanding your priorities I guess what do you think you know like first I think it's revealing that we think what happened here is so out of the ordinary I mean you flash back to 2001 to 2004. Sequoia I don't think funded a single loser in their portfolio right like that's a time where you walked away from the ones that weren't winning and you fed the ones that were because you have limited capital and you don't know when you're going to raise your next Capital this idea that you have unlimited Capital you can give money to anybody no matter what they're doing with respect to their plan I think is a function of the last 10 years but to jamas points the idea of tough talk you know either out of CEOs or out of board members has been in short supply in Silicon Valley this idea that saying the truth just speaking the words about needing to get fit or needing to lower the valuation that somehow that is found or unfriendly is nonsensical the truth is founder friendly by definition and I think to Chamas point the less complicated you make this right you reset the valuation you re-up the option pool and then everybody has a choice to make and if the people who are on the board and backing the company choose not to re-up for whatever reason they no longer believe in the path forward for the company that's incumbent upon the founder to go find people who will that's not abandonment as it's Being Framed in this story it is a trade and I think maybe if you look at Public Market investors Brad nobody gets upset by a trade trades a trade but in the private markets there's a lot more emotion involved a lot more relationship material and this founder friendly concept of like you're abandoning me it's like no the the trade here it makes no sense for this firm and for this fund and for these LPS right well sometimes sometimes the founder needs to have the courage to look in the mirror and say what I'm doing is not working I had a plan I missed the plan by 70 I'm lighting capital on fire this is a charity not a business it's best to say it didn't work shut it down and move on and do something else okay so of course
