macro welcome back to the Pod how's life been good to be back a little domar agato to you Jason as you eat your way through Japan yes I am on my culinary tour I'll be back Sunday but I am having the time of my life here are you running AdWords on your food blog that's what it's come back to back to the weblogs Inc days I'm just trying to make twenty six hundred dollars a day I noticed your Tick Tock got 22 likes yeah you know I'm trying to figure out Tick Tock I'm gonna but you know but right as they shut it down that's when I'll figure it out well that rev sure buy you another Japanese pancake or no those pancakes man our next level the fluffy pancakes here everything actually with the exchange rate coming to Japan is so affordable it's nuts and this is a crazy week because it's a Tokyo Marathon but everything is so affordable the people are amazing it's the best country to visit in the world I think for me it's Italy but I would say Japan is like it's definitely top two or three what do you love about it best food you know I went there I took the I took because like five years ago uh the older three at the time but they were younger and you know there's there's a negative birth rate in Japan and so number one when you have any kid but frankly multiple kids the the Japanese embrace you with so much love because they love seeing these big families yeah they're unbelievably kind we went to Kyoto did the professors walk saw the Cherry Blossom Festival basically ate our way through Japan that was my that was my only vacation trip I've done like 10 or 12 trips for work once we I went with Reed Hoffman and Reid set up this thing where we went through all these different parts of Tokyo and ate at this incredible sushi place you have to go with somebody who can dial it in yes and have all the hookups Brad you spend much time in Tokyo and Japan um I haven't I've uh been there only twice and that was when I was poor and I stayed in a really small room and ate really shitty food oh all right so uh you're saying in 20 in 2022 when you became Oregon all right and with us of course the next Department uh what what cabinet position you're going for sacks which should we start floating here oh my God here you are with the disinformation starting already it's a compliment Secretary of sash is with us DeSantis had a pretty great article on the Wall Street Journal oh really I missed I wanted it uh when they revoked the special administrative status for Disney he wrote an article I think it was Wednesday Tuesday or Wednesday in the in the Wall Street op-ed what was his uh premise that they was it corporate or is it culture that wokism is basically modern Marxism and we have to defeat it this is his language not mine at every turn and Disney needs to just be business people and not feed the vocal minorities inside of their company like every other company should they should be subject to shareholder concerns that apply to the majority of shareholders well I think this is why I think DeSantis is doing well with the Republican base and you know if you see polling if the Republican primary is he understands that it's not good enough just to have this sort of reagan-ass totally hands-off government approach because the radical left is advancing its agenda not just legislatively but through corporations through ESG really through taking over key private sector institutions and so he's willing to use government to push back on that agenda on behalf of parents or on behalf of you know what he sees as the majority of the country and so it's a very different approach than you know the Republican Party would have been 30 or 40 years ago this is why you know in the parlance of the base he understands what time it is and what's required here is not again this totally laser Fair approach but rather a much more energetic aggressive approach towards checking these bad ideas wherever they come from yeah it's not the only one I don't know if you saw this week Bill Maher went on a bit of a press tour and he was on with Jake Tapper and uh he made a very interesting I think point about liberalism versus wokism and it was quite articulate you know he's a pretty good Observer of culture he said they're kind of casting out the Liberals in the party for this wokism and the intolerant nature of the woke movement versus the liberal movement specifically under the lens of trans rights but let's put that aside for now we got a full docket before we get into the culture wars and the presidential elections let's start with uh we'll go private markets to public markets because they obviously dovetail so nicely
