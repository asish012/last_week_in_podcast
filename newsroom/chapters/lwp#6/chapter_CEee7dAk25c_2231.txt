to me this is the challenge Saks I think you could speak to this as well is we did all this portfolio management over the last year these were the troubled companies and then yet the company is a large person who did the right thing they had a big war chest and they had uh set the burn at the right pace and now they the other portion of our portfolio that had big war chests they're now at risk so if you're a capital allocator right now you're looking at a group of companies that you tried your best to save and their and they're angled and they're wounded and now the strong ones are wounded too this is cataclysmic for Silicon Valley if this does not get stopped this weekend not only and I I don't want to be hysterical you're right this is a meteor hitting the dinosaurs extension level event you're right Jake how listen we have portfolio companies that had tens or you know millions or more in yes Silicon Valley Bank and their account showed that their money was in the safest money market funds money market funds with a publicly traded ticker symbol that were managed by BlackRock or Morgan Stanley okay that's what their accounts showed them they had and then they're told all of a sudden no you're only protected up to 250 000 everything above that that your your money market fund is just an asset of svb which is in receivership you get a certificate yeah and you get a certificate do you see this announcement by the way regulator made things worse the California Regulators stepped in and they froze everything so our companies were in the process we have companies that submitted a wire Yesterday by the way we spent all day yesterday on the phone with our portfolio companies trying to get them out we had wire requests that went in before the deadline and for some reason we're in a queue they didn't get through and they didn't get out they didn't get through and then the California regulator steps in this morning and freezes everything and what did they announce they said oh you're good you're good for your insured amounts how much is that 250 000 for your uninsured amounts which is everything above 250 you're going to get a certificate a certificate what does that mean that means you're a creditor in bankruptcy so the mutual fund that you thought you owned was actually not hypothecated in your name it was in svb's name at BlackRock and so our companies have been calling BlackRock and calling Morgan Stanley saying hey do you have my money market fund and they're like no sorry that's svb so this is the crazy they're sitting in a in a creditor line in bankruptcy we got to explain this these were called sweep accounts so what Silicon Valley Bank did with uh some of these large portfolio holders let's say Saks and a bunch of other VCS gave you 30 million bucks yes and they would they took your money and they said you know what just to be safe we're gonna take your money we'll automatically sweep it and distribute it across two other accounts so we got this BlackRock over here for you great we got this Morgan Stanley over here great whatever it is you could only get to those through the Silicon Valley Bank interface and so it was supposed to protect you but there's no recourse it seems those are frozen too so the only thing you can do that's logical and I had a mentor 30 years ago when I had the magazine and we started hitting millions of dollars in revenue and he said I said how much money we have in the bank he's like which bank account and he had four bank accounts and he would load balance them and he did it every Friday God bless Elliott cook he did it every Friday for me and I've always done that I've always had multiple bank accounts and load balanced them but in this case Silicon Valley Bank did it through one interface I have multiple startups today who did this exact thing sex and they they couldn't even log into Silicon Valley bank today to even see where they're at I mean I think everything got Frozen and the California regulator froze them and they brought in the FDIC so there's a couple problems now with the working out of this this is basically a bankruptcy process receivership process it's that we've got all these companies and you make payroll in the next few weeks right and so these processes don't work at startup time if you could just figure out like over the weekend okay svb lost 30 cents on the dollar and everyone's just gonna be prorated you're gonna get 70 cents in the dollar and then you get your money on Monday it would be a hit to the Starbucks ecosystem but people would recover and move on but the fact the matter is it's not going to be on Monday it could take weeks or months to figure out how many cents on the dollar you have are they limited Silicon Valley Bank are they selling the gas is FDIC is going to liquidate everything well you have two paths here path number one is you if you actually try to sell these assets but the problem is who do you think the buyer is the buyer are the sharpest Sharps on Wall Street who will purposefully under bid these assets and so that then takes you to path two which is then the only other real solution is for the FED to Warehouse them and guarantee them and that's an equivalent version of what they had to do during the great financial crisis which it was this thing called tarp which is the troubled asset relief plan which was just a backstop and a mechanism so that these at the time those toxic assets which were a bunch of mortgage-backed loans could be cleared through the system over time which effectively meant that the FED basically warehoused that risk so I think what we need to see now is is sax it could be 50 cents on the dollar it could be 60 cents if you want immediate liquidity you know a friend in our group chat was mentioning that there was one claim a company that had a hundred million dollars inside of svb was offered 60 cents on the dollar today for that claim now the third party from a third party who said I will take you I will give you 60 million today in return for that certificate plus the 250 000 that says Euro to 100 million because they're willing to take the risk that they'll get you know 80 million right and then they take the difference now the point is that if you're TR if you're seeing today that kind of a discount that's not a good sign I think and it does speak to the fact that Regulators have to step in now here's the other reason why I think it's important I think what regulators and I think the people and there's a lot of them in Washington that listen to this what this does is it torches years of U.S innovation and you should not let that happen there are companies working on really important things for the United States and for the rest of the world and if it's if if the company fails because they can't make the product work so be it we take that risk every day if the company fails because customers don't want to buy it so be it if the product fails because a better product comes out so be it but it shouldn't fail because we can't get money yeah because you forgot your paper that should not be why we torched hundreds of startups in what they're working on this is maybe thousands yeah this is a this would be a lost decade a lost decade for so first of all do you guys want to talk about second and third or third order effects because I think it's important to highlight why it's not just about a couple hundred Tech Bros in Silicon Valley not being able to make payroll but there's important Downstream consequences for example there were payment processing companies in Silicon Valley that use Silicon Valley Bank to store their capital and to to move money around there are payroll companies that do payroll for many businesses not just Tech businesses but many businesses in different parts of the economy that store their cash at Silicon Valley Bank and process money through Silicon Valley Bank today was announced that Rippling one of those companies could not hit their payroll cycle today because they had money tied up at Silicon Valley Bank fortunately they announced that they also have money at JP Morgan and other places so they will be able to kind of get the the payroll processed early next week and get everyone back on track but this is hundreds and potentially thousands of companies that use their payroll software to to process and pay their employees and then there's all the payment processors we don't know how many of them have what level of exposure and a lot of infrastructure companies that move money in and through Silicon Valley Bank and so if they start to go down and then payroll doesn't hit the air conditioning company that's using the the tool and some you know in Arizona and then you know the the stripe service isn't able to process e-commerce payments for a small business owner that runs a website you can start to see how there can be very significant trickling effects and more important like we saw in 08 perhaps to a different degree but still a significant concern is the the the contagion of panic where people say if there isn't reliability in the things that I thought were reliable before I start to have real questions in the soundness of the system overall and that's why it's so important that Sac said to step in Shore up the problem this weekend I don't think it's about bidding 50 cents or 60 cents on the dollar every depositor needs to get paid 100 of their money and that cash needs to be made available to them by early next week and if that money is not available to them if within the first 48 or 72 hours of the end of this weekend then we are going to have a real crisis on our hands because then you will see a lot of people trying to move money away from any institution that stores their money in some sort of security that's not 100 liquid like cash and that's going to cost that's gonna cause a massive run and so some what has to happen the only way this can happen is if someone takes over Silicon Valley Bank this weekend and that the federal government unfortunately as much as I hate to say it because I absolutely hate the federal government having a role in this stuff has to say we will guarantee 100 of those deposits to the company that takes over the bank that takes over this portfolio and says let the port folio of assets run its lifetime see what you get paid whatever the Delta is we'll make it up to you but we need to make sure that there's cash here today for all of these depositors if you had something you wanted to say if not I have something I want to say yeah the other big thing that svb was was an on-ramp for a lot of investors including many U.S investors to get money into China and without commenting on whether that's right wrong or indifferent the point is that China has a very complicated Capital Market structure which requires you to basically use an offshore Bank I.E non-domesticated Chinese bank and to be able to get those dollars and so what would happen is Chinese startups that raise money would raise money from U.S investors and abroad using these bank accounts and so this issue now doesn't just touch the United States Innovation economy it also touches China's Innovation economy which you know creates actually a complicated set of trade-offs for the U.S government and treasury as they think about what they want to do in this heightening great power conflict that sax talked about last week and I want to just make a very important nuanced Point here I know there is no bank that the public specifically you know people who don't want to support you know rich people already like big Tech or billionaires the the reason to backstop this with public money is because we have a road map for this people don't know this uh widely but tarp was just over 400 billion dollars it actually returned a 15 billion dollar profit to the American people this would require maybe 25 or 50 billion dollars ten percent maybe five ten percent of the totality of tarp would be enough to cover What's Happening Here with Silicon Valley Bank and work this out that's 50 billion dollars for the people listening in Washington or for the people who will say hey why are we you know bailing out big Tech you're bailing out small Tech as Tremont said you're bailing out Innovation on breast cancer on you know uh renewable energy but most importantly this can easily be structured so that the American people return twenty percent thirty percent maybe even double their money you could structure this so it is senior to everything else and is exactly what the government is supposed to do when there is a crisis that doesn't mean the people who run Silicon Valley Bank should have their Equity worth a lot they should get wiped out they didn't do their job properly the equity the people who ran the management team there if they don't get anything that's okay they understand that but the people who had their money at deposit to pay the salaries and to pay for this Innovation it is unconscionable that we wouldn't backstop it and the I guarantee you the US government could get some warrants on those companies or warrants and ownership in Silicon Valley bank and make at least 50 cents on the dollar maybe even double and that's the way this bailout should be structured and it has to be done this weekend you bring up a great idea I think I think if the U.S balance sheet does step in over the weekend I'm going to say on behalf of the U.S taxpayer you must get a piece of these companies and the reason why is that that's the way to make it fair for everybody that's not in Tech who's on the outside looking in and if you look inside of Twitter as an example there's a lot of negative sentiment around even the idea of a bailout happening and it's for this exact reason because I think people believe that it will benefit just a small sliver of people right so to step in and to save these companies Jason would still be you know really only helping say several hundred thousand or several you know and and the thing that that gets wrong in my opinion is that these companies if they're if they're allowed to germinate should be building things that actually help everybody including and so if you can view it that way and if you can view a share of it now obviously look we're very we have a very deep incentive for that to happen but I think it's important to present the other side of it and the other side would say this industry has a little bit run amok it's not well regulated

    "title":"Startups at Risk After the Failure of Silicon Valley Bank", 
    "summary":"The failure of Silicon Valley Bank could be catastrophic for startups in Silicon Valley. Companies that have tens of millions of dollars in the bank are finding out that they may not have access to their funds. The bank held money market funds that were managed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley and marketed as safe investments. The accounts of these startups are showing that they only have access to insured amounts, up to $250,000, and the rest will be a certificate of debt. The California Regulator has frozen the assets and announced that only the insured amounts are guaranteed. The startups are at risk of not making payroll and bankruptcy proceedings could take weeks or months, and the only viable solution is for the FED to Warehouse them and guarantee them."
