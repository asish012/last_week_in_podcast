hours here we're gonna get into Silicon Valley Bank imploding the FDIC has shut down Silicon Valley Bank and there's many different things we have to discuss with me today as always the dictator himself the Rain Man David sacks and the prince of panic attacks no more his wires cleared David Friedberg the Sultan of science welcome boys how is everybody just to start this off contextually the last 24 hours can you can you recall a time in our careers where it's felt this acute or insane or intense uh 2008 and covet okay and I think that this is right up there could be two probably three in terms of the level of panic and concern the problem is we're in the middle of it we don't know what's going to happen this weekend so there's a lot of anxiety right now a lot of panic going on and a lot of like unlike covid and 08 really acute effects that many companies and investors are actively dealing with right now like not just a few thousands of companies that are really in a state of like distress right now so it is um potentially from a Silicon Valley perspective worse than 08 or covet oh for sure for sure I mean this this is basically a Lehman sized event for Silicon Valley remember when Lehman Brothers went out of the basically fall for bankruptcy in 2008 started the whole financial crisis the federal authorities thought that the best plan for Lehman was to file for bankruptcy they didn't try to save it and that basically led to a Cascade where the whole financial system almost collapsed I think that svb this is a lehman-sized event for Silicon Valley and there's there's two big things happening one is the impact on the startup ecosystem so you're seeing probably thousands of companies now cannot make payroll in the next few weeks because their money is trapped and tied up at Silicon Valley Bank which is now under receivership so if you wired your money out yesterday you're good and a lot of people managed to do that but there are a lot of people who were had wires in the hopper didn't make it today logged into the website can't log in the monies is frozen and we don't know when they're gonna be able to get their money out or how many cents of the dollar they're going to get so basically the whole startup ecosystem is in Peril I think Gary tan called it an extinction level event yes exactly that was a good term and just to make it really clear this is not big Tech at risk I know there's a lot of people out there who don't like the idea of bailing out big Tech this is not Google it's not absolutely those companies have plenty of cash they're fine this is small companies companies with 10 to 100 employees and you're looking at maybe thousands of them just being wiped out for no reason they didn't do anything wrong because of this this could have a very damaging effect on the startup economy and the whole United States economy this is little Tech these are the future companies that will keep the United States competitive versus China and the rest of the world and then the other big thing that's happening this all happening in real time is a regional banking crisis because when depositors see that their money was not safe at svb which was a top 20 bank that as far as everyone knows was in Regulatory Compliance nobody has said that svb wasn't compliant as far as we know they had a regulator Steel of approval and now you find out your money was not safe and it's not FDIC insured above 250 000 so the conversations we're all seeing in our chat groups with leading investors is why the hell would you keep your money anywhere but JPMorgan or a top four bank and so I think that unless the FED steps in here over the weekend we're going to see potentially a a run on the regional banking system a Cascade like we saw in 2008. well sax let's let's just take a step back before because I think you're right but we should talk about why that happens the contagion drivers and just so people know Silicon Valley Bank is used by 50 percent of venture-backed startups and I would say the majority of venture firms also have their money there so this morning I got a note from uh fund I'm an LPN they had millions of dollars that they can't access to invest in startups so chamoth there are many products and services that Silicon Valley provides one is you know banking services to startups another is to venture capitalists they do the mortgages for Banker for Venture capitalists and for Founders as well they provide those kind of white glove services but you also mentioned in our group chat they also provide loans to GPS General Partners to people who run uh Venture firms so the impact could also hit there maybe you could explain what that is and then we'll get into what happened here yeah well I think it's important maybe actually just for Freeburg to just explain what's happening but okay can maybe maybe let me just do the lead-in and then Friedberg can do the details but for for those that are far away and aren't even sure what's going on the basic problem that we have right now is in the last 36 hours a key part of the financial Plumbing of Silicon Valley has basically been turned off and as a result billions of dollars of deposits have basically um been frozen it means that people can't pay their bills it means that people can't access their deposits it means that credit lines could be in default it means that payroll can't be met and so as a result we have this potential Contagion on our hands but in order to understand it on a packet I think it's important to explain exactly how this came to pass so let me just hand the ball to Freeburg and then we can talk about some of the implications of which there are many yeah before Freeburg starts with the why just the what that's happened as well this all started on Wednesday evening when Silicon Valley Bank's CEO published a letter to shareholders announcing that the bank was rebalancing its balance sheet by selling tens of billions of dollars worth of mostly U.S Securities I'm sorry treasuries and then they announced they would raise some money and sell some shares in Silicon Valley Bank the then the shares in Silicon Valley Bank is a publicly traded entity dropped 60 on Thursday then another 60 on Friday of course then the entire world got focused on this and then every venture capitalist started telling or I would say the overwhelming majority of venture capitalists told their Founders to get their money out of svb then you had a classic run on the bank a small number of venture capitalists gave advice to say hey we should support Silicon Valley Bank I understand that but it turned out to be really bad advice and then trading uh was halted on Friday morning pending news and then finally the FDIC shut down Silicon Valley Bank at noon on Friday and there's a lot of speculation of what will happen on the win over the weekend but maybe you could walk us through technically what happened to Silicon Valley Bank and why they had this cash shortfall and this we spend the run of the bank basically but what led up to this the irony is it really was and is prior to the quote run a financially solvent business so I I have a few slides to Fair on YouTube you can see it that we pulled one slide that was kind of made by us and the other set that come from Silicon Valley Bank's actual presentations but if you look at their balance sheet this is from the end of the year 2022 um you can kind of look at the you know stuff that they owe their their liabilities which is what they owe their customers that sits in deposits because when customers give you cash in a deposit you owe them that money back so that sits us a liability and then they had a some other debt so in total Silicon Valley Bank at the end of the year had about 195 billion dollars in liability it's 173 billion of customer deposits that they owe to customers and 22 billion of other debt and then they take those customer deposits and they invest it in in a number of Securities and the way that a balance sheet business like this bank would operate is you know the customers have access to their cash um anytime they want but in order for the bank to make money they make longer duration Investments and those longer duration Investments give them the ability to earn money on those longer duration Investments more than they're paying the customers for the deposit so if you look at their longer duration Investments they had about 208 billion dollars um of total assets sitting on the balance sheet so compare that to the 195 billion that they owe customers and and other debt holders so you know the difference here between 208 and 195 is about 13 billion dollars that's kind of the net what people would call Book value of Silicon Valley Bank at the end of the year and of the 208 billion of assets that they had not 74 billion were loans and they've got a breakdown of the loan portfolio here in a minute 91 billion where these hold to maturity Securities where they don't actually adjust the value of these on a quarterly basis and 26 billion is what triggered this Panic which is available for sale Securities mostly treasuries and what happened is Silicon Valley Banks deposits came in so quickly over the last couple of years that they went out and they bought a bunch of treasuries you know with the cash that they got and the problem is that very quickly Freeburg is actually MBS they bought a bunch of MBS tenure division MBS an important to note of the 208 billion that they have the book value Friedberg there was a whatever 10 if it's in cash or something so they do have some cash there that's right yeah sorry it's a good point if you go back so like you know let's say that of the 100 of the 173 billion of customer deposits you know they've got 14 billion of cash and then they've got all these treasury Securities they can sell call it 40 billion so if 25 of customers said tomorrow hey we want our cash back theoretically they could just dump those treasury Securities distribute the cash and give it all back to customers the problem is if suddenly more than 25 percent want to get their cash back well now they have a problem and that is effectively what triggers the run on the bank as soon as some folks think that others might be pulling money out then everyone rushes to be the first money out the door and that's what triggers a classic run on the bank there's a statistic I think in the 1920s there were several hundred banks that had runs every year for almost the entire decade and these this was like a regular kind of occurrence that happened in the 1920s that ushered in a lot of our modern Securities laws that are meant to kind of create the necessary liquidity provisions and how these banks are able to operate to make cash available to customers but what happened is so much so by the way Freeburg that they made a movie It's a Wonderful Life about bankrupt so basically one of the bigger problems that Silicon Valley Bank they ran into two big problems number one is the closet decline where uh VCS were not investing new money and when they were not investing you money and startups were burning more money than Silicon Valley had modeled they would be burning because they thought everyone was going to reduce spend and reduce burn and they didn't so deposits were going down while all these startups were burning money no VCS were investing so total deposits were on the decline meanwhile their bond portfolio the assets that they hold on the balance sheet also declined in value and I and I kind of just put a really simple illustration here on why if you have a hundred dollar kind of face value bond that earns two percent uh which is basically you know where these treasuries were a year ago and you and you hold that for 10 years that 10-year bond yields 122 dollars if the interest rate goes up to five percent then though that that that Bond should yield 163 dollars so the value of the first Bond actually goes down by 25 because of the market conditions that's how significant the value changes with just a three percent change in the interest rates and that's effectively what happened with that available for security segment of the Silicon Valley Bank portfolio balance sheet they had this Bond portfolio that suddenly got devalued and they had declining deposits so when deposits start to decline you got to make sure you have enough assets sitting on the balance sheet so they sold a bunch of them said we're going to raise more money and at that point everyone kind of perked their head up and said oh my gosh what's crazy is in Q4 by the way Seeking Alpha this website you guys know they had actually done an analysis instead of svb about to blow up and they put together a bunch of slides that highlighted why this might be the case because they saw that deposits were declining that their um their assets that they hold were basically declining in value because of the massive and very quick rise in interest rates and that svb had bought a bunch of bonds that were long long durated bonds so it led to a you know obviously a real short-term problem if you look at the rest of svb's loan portfolio there's also a question of how distressed that all is so 10 of their 70 billion plus dollars of loans is in Venture debt and Venture debt is very questionable in this market right because historically the way Venture debt makes money is that they assume that VCS are going to keep funding the companies that they're providing debt to and if the VC stopped funding the companies then the Venture debt defaults and so if you go to the last slide in this deck you'll kind of see svb's performance on their Venture debt portfolio yeah so look at this this is the the performance results on just the warrants that they get on their your debt so when you when you issue Venture debt you take a write down or you get paid back and then you also get some warrants you get some a right to buy shares in the in the winners and the startups that work and so the way that svbs made money on their Venture debt portfolio historically is hopefully they get paid back on all their loans some of them they don't but then they'll make a bunch of money on selling their warrants or the pub companies going public or getting bought and in Q4 of 2022 it just fell off a cliff and their Venture debt portfolio really started to show distress and that's 10 are these realized gains or these are Mark to market gains this is the net gains on on their warrant so they

This could have a damaging effect on the startup economy and the whole United States economy, and a run on the regional banking system could occur unless the Fed steps in.
