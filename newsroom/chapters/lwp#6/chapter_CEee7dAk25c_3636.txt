you guys think this means for VC it is a chilling effect I I talked with some LPS in the last two days in the VC World I'll give you a couple anecdotes I have a friend runs a fund he looked at his portfolio they have 270 million dollars or sorry 350 million dollars tied up at Silicon Valley Bank they need 27 million dollars uh for cash for the next 30 days so he's called his LPS and he's trying to get his LPS uh to front him money to wire money so that he can front his company's money so they can actually pay their operating expenses and cover their payroll and then I spoke with a couple of LPS in the last 48 hours um they have gotten dozens of calls from various Venture funds everyone is asking the same question can we do a capital call can we get money delivered early can we use that money to support our companies because their cash is stuck coming out of this the the the uncertainty that this creates in the investment environment um I think it's going to have a real chilling effect not just with the GPS and their you know uh proclivity to sign term sheets right now and wire new money over but also with the LPS as they're making Capital commitments and actually following through with with capital commitments that have already been made um given uh you know where's the capital actually going to land up that was never a question mark before it was never in anything that anyone even considered that Capital could be disappeared or locked up or tied up and the fact that this is adding this unique friction in the market is the layer on top of an already distressed and challenged environment for fundraising for GPS for LPS and it seems to um be exactly the icing on the cake we did not need right now no matter how this gets resolved I I think private markets in BC could seize I think you're going to see people pull term sheets maybe half as many fundings are going to occur as people try to do triage another VC friend of mine just sent me a text he can't make payroll next week he's a fund for his VC fund his VC fund their employees cannot he cannot pay his employees on Monday Lord and so um yes I do think funds could shut down uh coming out of this it I think that companies that were call it you know 75 distressed are done for now no one's going to step in and Bridge them and fund them uh it's going to accelerate a lot of shutdowns because people are now cash is King now cash is king or right it's like a big shift I think that was really well said I think you're you're right about all that Jake how you tweeted that you think this is going to cause a 60-day freeze and and deal making activity I think that's more or less right you're right because you know all the VCS out there have to think about Shoring up their existing portfolios exactly what if you got companies that are now in distress that are perfectly good companies you've got to focus you're picking one or two winners you know and you're going to focus on that you're going to say you know what the rest of them could be good but I can't it's it's going to be a tough decision I have three open deals right now um that we're doing I now have to figure out how to get those deals done and I have four companies that are in this payroll situation in a major way so now I've got capital and I've got to and we're not personally affected by the Silicon Valley Bank thing thank God but now we have to do triage the known winners in your portfolio that did nothing wrong or do you make the next three Investments or four Investments and I'm gonna make good on those three Investments but next month Maybe not maybe next month I'm taking off and I'm focusing on the portfolio and I think that's what's going to happen writ large we're in triage mode now full on triage mode if this doesn't get resolved if they can't get those what do you think it's dark I had a meeting three weeks ago with the US LP and you know you guys know how I run this business here but it's there's there's like a lot of risk management you know we think about this stuff a lot and the message that came back to me was I don't think risk management is worthwhile in Venture I didn't understand where that was coming from um because if you're investing your money across a very risky asset class you have to be always thinking about how you could lose money and I think that venture has always romantically been described as like buying lottery tickets and so it doesn't matter if you lose but when you have that kind of latitude you just become super complacent and you don't think about left tail risk you only think about right tail outcomes and this is an example of like left tail risk that came out of nowhere that could wipe out entire portfolios so you had you know folks invest into funds that spent a few years probably 2019 2020 2021 really misallocating money right writing ginormous checks into companies at valuations that didn't make sense who then went and burned it and now what little cash they had left may also be gone which means those valuations are even more impaired which means that the LPS that gave them the money are even more underwater and that cycle I think is really terrible that'll take a so maybe this is the wake-up call where now risk management is actually in Vogue and cool and it's important to know this stuff I don't know we have breaking news uh while we're taping this the Department of Financial Protection and innovation of the State of California has published findings on svb we'll pull it up on the screen for the besties to respond to on March 8 2023 the bank announced a loss of approximately 1.8 billion from the sale of Investments we've talked about that already on March 8th 2023 the bank's holding company announced it was conducting a capital raise despite the bank being in sound financial condition prior to March 9th 2023 investors and depositors reacted by initiating withdrawals of 42 billion dollars in deposits so that would be over 20 I think of the of the total deposits from the bank on March 9th or even more 2023 causing a run on the bank as of the close of business on March 9th the bank had a negative cash balance of approximately 958 million despite attempts from the bank with the assistance of regulators to transfer collateral from various sources to bank it did not meet its cash letter with the Federal Reserve the precipitous deposit withdrawal has caused the bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due right and the bank is now inside the beginning 42 billion dollars uh is 25 of total deposits but 42 billion is greater than the 14 billion of cash they had on hand and the 26 billion of liquid Securities that they had so you add those two up together you're at 40 billion and then to get more cash they're gonna have to sell a bunch of loan portfolios and selling loan portfolios you got to package them up it takes weeks or months to do that and they're going to be sold to distressed prices so this is where a classic run-on-the-bank problem actually causes a decline in the asset value of the business uh and the assets that they own because if you have to go and turn around and sell those assets in the market super fast you're going to take a huge loss you guys remember that movie Margin Call with Demi Moore and um what's his name and they make this plan to go and Mark and they're like Swayze no not Patrick Swayze uh no the Jeremy Irons Jeremy Irons he plays the best character he's like the chairman of the bank and they're like we have to sell all this but we're gonna take a huge loss and they make this big trade that happens at the beginning of the morning but that's what happens when you have to sell a lot of assets very fast as you guys know you end up selling them at a discount so the rate at which deposits are coming out of the bank can actually impact the asset value held at the bank and that's fundamentally what a run on the bank causes and the irony is as they point out the company was fundamentally financially sound they had enough assets marked at the current market value or whatever to meet all of their obligations but the rate at which assets started to get pulled out is what drove those that drove the company the bank into distress and if you think about it it it's it's an ironic point of view on Silicon Valley because Silicon Valley operates with such we all joke about what a herd mentality uh and and what an incredibly tied and and deep Network Silicon Valley is we all got dozens and hundreds of texts and messages from friends colleagues co-workers yesterday all relaying the news about what they were going to do and as soon as that happened that's how tightly intertwined Silicon Valley is within 24 hours every CEO and every venture capitalist was on a chat group or on a message group with other people in the valley and once there was any indication of panic the entire Market flipped and you guys saw this we all saw this within 24 hours the beginning of a day yesterday it was like they'll get through it it'll be fine they just took a little mark down on their portfolio they got plenty of assets but then it's like well Founders fund said we should probably get out okay well Founders fun is getting out maybe we should get out before everyone else does well we got to get up before everyone else does let's do it now I'm getting out right now I'm telling my best friend I'm getting out right now and then everyone tells their second best friend and then all of a sudden the whole valley knows it and then the whole valley is running for the door and this is a really interesting and unique scenario it's not like the classic consumer run on the bank where you're trying to pull cash out it's the Silicon Valley 24-hour cycle of we all got to do it because everyone else is doing like what we're seeing with investing Cycles in Silicon Valley where everyone chases and these bubbles emerge the reverse I think happened yesterday where the herd mentality drove us all to rush for the door as quickly as possible you know I'm not sure that that that might be why it's not as much of a contagion you know as you might expect elsewhere because places other kind of regional Banks don't have the same sort of intertwinedness as we saw with all the depositors here in Silicon Valley Bank I don't know I don't know this is where um I think that describing what happens as a panic kind of misses the fundamental rationality of the response so both are true by the way yeah so it does seem like a panic but that doesn't mean that each individual decision Maker's motivation is panic I actually think it's a rational upside downside calculation I mean this is all Game Theory so if you think that there's a risk of other people pulling out their assets and in fact you're hearing that they are you don't want to wait and be the last one to leave and so you think about it there's no penalty or downside to taking your money out right so the the downside of taking your funds out immediately is zero and the upside is you might save 100 of your money so it's it's a rational decision when confidence is lost to take out your money and in fact it was rational there were a bunch of VCS not a lot but some of them between yesterday that you know sgb has been a great player in the ecosystem for 30 years we should show our support right now by not taking our money out well guess what what happened to them they got stuck and now their money is frozen and they're not sure whether they get you know Pennies on the dollar or not whereas the people who rushed for the exits yesterday got their money out prisoner's dilemma it is a prisoner's dilemma but here's the thing it's it's not even about anymore whether the institution is solvent it's about whether there's confidence and I think there is a risk now of contagion spreading to these other Regional Banks because people aren't sure and there's already huge cash outflows leaving these other Banks because why take a chance the game theory of it is move your money out until this is over and if you're okay with you know moving it back in a few weeks if it turns out not to be around the bank that's fine so a lot of this can be self-fulfilling you have to remember that runs on the bank freeway you said this a hundred years ago were extremely common every decade there would be a giant Financial panic and there'd be a run on the bank run on many banks and the only way that the federal government stopped it was by introducing FDIC and they said they said to depositors your money is safe and at that time 250 000 was enough the problem we have is that with these business Banks 250 000 is not enough so all of a sudden there's going to be a crisis of confidence if you think a business bank can go under again you're just going to leave all these Regional Banks you're going to go to the top four that's going to be it so I I think that that the situation right now is really Dynamic and If the Fed does nothing and just says up you know these uh depositors should have known better you know the losses on them then I think the rational reaction for depositors at all these other Banks would be just to leave because I don't think depositors are in a good position to assess the uh liquidity and credit worthiness of a bank I just don't think they are I think stockholders are they're the people who should lose all their money if the bank goes under but not depositors any advice or takeaways for Founders and capital allocators going forward obviously have your money in multiple bank accounts I sent you guys a list that was just published of all of the funds that custody at svb and it's unbelievable the list it's every single major VC in Silicon Valley wow where'd you get this I have my ways oh extracted from SEC filings got it okay thank you yeah this is amazing wow holy I mean everybody's in there 500 Sequoia we're going pretty fast here but yeah to find I mean this is that we were we were out a few months ago when we were talking about Venture debt on the Pod I didn't believe that sgb should be in this business so I told oh look there's craft there's craft no well hold on I'll tell you does it say how much money we got in there yeah go to the right I'll tell you what happened is so after the conversation we had on this the show about Venture debt I'm like I don't really like that sgb's in this business so I told my guys set up an account somewhere else so we did that so we moved our firm accounts over and we w

    "title":"How Silicon Valley Bank's shutdown affects VC funds and start-ups", 
    "summary":"Silicon Valley Bank's service disruption has caused a major setback to venture capital (VC) funds and start-ups. Many VC funds are unable to access their funds due to the shutdown and are struggling to pay their employees and operating expenses. They are asking limited partners (LPS) for help to get money delivered early and support their companies. This unique friction in the market has created a chilling effect on investment and could lead to half as many fundings. VCs are in triage mode and are focusing on shoring up their existing portfolios. There is a fear that this shutdown could cause funds to shut down and accelerate a lot of shutdowns. The risk management in venture has become complacent and there is a need to think about left-tail risk as well. The shutdown has made cash the king, and many start-ups that were distressed are done for now."
