just mentioned this is we the four of us have been talking for the last 18 months about the impact of rising rates and you know we talked a lot about for example like in our portfolio my partners and I walked into every company and made them have at least enough money to get through mid 2025 right I've said this a bunch of times and so that was about having very difficult conversations about making sure that you were husbanding cash so that you had enough to weather any storm that came on the horizon but it turns out that there was some group of VCS and companies that just didn't get that memo and just kept spending like nothing had changed but when other VCS have stopped giving you money and you're continuing to spend like it was 2020 that's what caused this mismatch and it was really the spark that Lit the fuse so I think it's a really sad commentary at some level about the lack of governance that we have inside of some of these companies where folks are just not doing the job that they're supposed to at these board levels I think people and we've talked about this have made venture too much of a popularity contest where they are you know glad handing and smiling and not doing the hard work of holding folks accountable and so some handful of VCS and some handful of founders just didn't get this memo and it made what could have been a slower train wreck faster unnecessarily so I think that that's worth talking about then I think if you look at what actually practically happened over the last year and a half at svb was that they were so desirous of profits that they basically had a duration mismatch so what is that imagine you get a job and you know somebody's like hey Freeburg I'll pay you a hundred thousand dollars monthly over some number of months right in in normal pay every two weeks or I'll pay you 200 000 but you only get paid once a year well the problem with that second thing is you still have monthly bills that you have to make up for before you get paid and so most people wouldn't take that job even if they paid you a lot more because you have this durational mismatch you have to pay rent every month you have to pay bills on a monthly basis you have credit card bills all these things and so you need to match the timing of your cash flows and so I think somewhere along the way the risk Folks at svb just made a really large miscalculation they basically went and bought 10-year risk in order to pay back money that could be called on a daily or weekly basis that obviously in hindsight was not a good idea but more importantly and they didn't adjust fast enough well they can't because they have these Mark to Market assets that were just getting clobbered in the head as rates got raised and then the Third the third thing is around Regulators you know after the great financial crisis we went through a period where there was hundreds of bank failures and then for the last decade they've been virtually none right they've been like a few here or there and the last one was just during covet and so the The Regulators I think have done a really good job with Dodd-Frank and all of these other things to clean up the banking laws and the reporting requirements and the capital structures so that runs on banks are more and more infrequent but they kept this crazy loophole around the accounting treatment of assets and they allow these durational mismatches to appear in A bank's balance sheet and so I think there's a piece here for The Regulators which is here's an opportunity that's glaring and obvious now and screaming about how we need to tighten some more of the transparency that's required it shouldn't be a group of armchair salutes on Seeking Alpha that sniff this out three months before it happened it should have actually been a regulator that said hey hold on a second something is happening here that we don't like and so we I think need to figure it out but I think those are the three actors that are in play and they each share a bit of the blame here Freeburg Sachs what do you think who who is to blame here most for this blow up or is this just the extraogenous event of the rate hikes happening in such a short compressed period of time no I mean look I think that svb's risk management was terrible obviously they signed up for these long data Securities when the the market they serve is incredibly volatile like Jamal says duration mismatch really good point I would also say that there's a weird regulatory treatment where apparently if you buy these 10-year bonds these 10-year mortgage-backed Securities or 10-year treasuries you don't have to recognize the loss until you sell them which is just bizarre so in other words they should have been marking the the positions to Market and instead they just were allowing these losses to accrue I don't understand how The Regulators can allow that kind of system I also don't understand how The Regulators can allow a bank to take customer deposits and loan them out to startups with this Venture debt that we've been talking about in the show where 10 percent of their portfolio is basically being loaned out to startups who have no credit that's crazy we talked on the show a few months ago yeah actually it's a good time to play the clip here because what we saw and sax and I you know seeing at the series a level you have a lot of times Founders would get this basically free money in their minds I raised 10 I get five in Venture debt I can extend my Runway but that money comes due and here's the clip for when Saks and I were talking about it just a couple episodes ago what I don't trust is whether the the return models on Venture debt that were created over the last five to ten years will be a good predictor of what the returns will be in the next five ten years when a lot of the mortality that should have happened in the past now happens in the future yeah I mean this is just four or five episodes ago we had kind of nailed it startups have no collateral they have no there's no security for that load how does that make sense no not true loan to a creditor not true guys look I I disagree with you on this point look if you pull up the the slide that breaks down so let's talk about Venture debt for a second because I've actually invested in a venture debt fund and I've seen the economics on it the way that the The Venture debt model typically works is the lender loans Money to the startup and what they underwrite is what the current VCS and the startup say they're going to do to support the company in the future so their ability to get paid back in the future is largely predicated not on underwriting the company and the performance of the business or the assets they have but it's underrated by the fact that the VCS are committed to continuing to put money in and hopefully see that this thing has a bigger there's no commitment there is no commitment hold on let me just finish I get it but but the asset as a as an asset class we can make fun of it all we want it's actually performed pretty well these guys have generated typically 18 as an industry and yeah you're right it's the same as Ventures and the way that they generate those returns is that they're loaning money to the startups a bunch of those startups fail they don't get paid back and then the ones that succeed they actually take warrants in the startups so they have some Equity upside in the startup and that's the way the model works we can make fun of it all we want it actually works as an industry let me tell you why that broke is um it goes back to the point you made earlier in the show which is the the the lender has this expectation that the VCS are going to keep investing what if they don't well we've been in a generally up into the right bull market since the last that's right yeah I believe from the data for all these models is is skewed because it assumes again an environment in which companies keep raising up rounds and as soon as you get into a crisis in which the that breaks then the whole asset class breaks that's right I think this was completely predictable but even if you think that this asset class is legitimate I don't understand why banking deposits could ever be used to fund it if you want to be a venture debt fund go out and raise money from LPS because what happens is when you raise it with customer deposits you're creating systemic risks for the banking systems should never have allowed that even worse under two assets are correlated because you're you're loaning it to people who are depositing it and in every other part of the private credit Market that is exactly what you do what Sac said you can't use custard customer deposits to do some clo deal or to do like you know to back a PE play these are all LP Capital that goes towards that this is the only sliver as far as I know where you take customer deposits to create very risky loans wrapped with warrant coverage and by the way this stuff is never free right so they make you keep your money there they make you have enough money to cover the size of the loan in the first place so it's not even that valuable because if they give you eight million dollar loan you have to have eight million dollars always on deposit otherwise you violate the otherwise you know you breached alone so there is no free lunch in Venture debt there has never been and I still think Venture debt is very much like Venture Capital which is most of these gains are on paper most of these gains haven't really been realized and now we're going to go through this sorting process when all of this stuff gets whacked I do want sexy your reaction to this though which is the thing that started this was the fact that VCS seeing the markets imploding stopped giving companies money but they didn't do enough work to help Founders cut burn what is going on inside of these boys I think that's crazy because listen I mean we started doing portfolio updates with our entire portfolio of Founders in February last year saying this regime change you've got to cut costs we did another one in May you can watch them both on YouTube okay and we were telling Founders cut your burn do it now don't wait we were beating the drum on this so hard and in every board meeting and privately and I like you know and it takes multiple times frankly to get through I think your point chamoth about not wanting to be unpopular with the founder crowd uh LED some young Capital allocators to maybe say okay yeah let's try this ditch effort before we do you know another riff let's try this new product let's change our sales strategy I don't think it's young versus old I think it's experience versus unexperienced no I think it's experience that's better I think that's right yeah the experiences listen if you've never lived through a bear Market you don't know how bad it can get and Tech is a boom bust cycle and the bus are really hard really hard really hard and if you've never lived through a regime change before like there was in 2008 nine or in 2000 and 2000 was the worst yeah 2001 to three yeah you're totally improved you have no idea and you know and and I think experience does matter and there there aren't that many VCS around who live through the.com craft no probably 85 if not by the way if you guys pull up just that slide on the loan portfolio at svb I just want to make the case a sex I hear you it's a risky it seems like a risky investment to make but what don't you guys agree that a balance sheet business like svb or an insurance company or any business that has you know some amount of money coming in that sits on the balance sheet and then they invested for a period of time there's a laddering of risk and there's a laddering of duration that you have and so if you look at Silicon Valley Bank from there from the update they did last week that figured all of this if you look at svb's loan portfolio 70 are really these asset back loans which are 56 of the portfolio is like you know prepayments on on LP commitments and then 14 is is private banking loans which is loans against you know public Securities that people have only 10 of the portfolio is ventured at which is 7 billion and you know look if the asset historically is performed at an 18 kind of rate of return what is the you venture debt portfolio going to look like in a distressed environment is it negative 100 is it negative 50 negative 40 negative 30 I mean you guys can have a point of view on this but you look I mean for any business that's managing a large um balance sheet of assets against you know a short uh kind of liability tree they're gonna have some riskier assets I think you know the question is was 10 too much of the loan portfolio I think one percent's too much yeah you know one of the issues here that we saw qualitatively sax and I both saw qualitatively is the standard for giving these and the size of them got lower and lower in fact the covenants went away and this is what we kept having 100 say to us it has no covenants they offered me no covenants I don't have to have a certain amount of cash I don't have half a certain amount of Revenue those covenants were there for a reason to filter out the people who can't afford the house right and this is exactly what happened in 2008 when people started giving those no recourse or no uh background check mortgages remember those where like you didn't have to do a background check to get a mortgage that's what happened in Venture they just gave these I saw it firsthand willy-nilly I begged Founders to not take them and I only won that discussion sacks one out of five times because Founders are like money we're having this debate but there's no indication and there were no losses in this portfolio to date that showed that Venture that's underperforming we're we're saying past performance is no guarantee of future performance exactly because it's obvious to us on this podcast you guys are arguing about Venture debt when the real loss that happened at svb no we understand that they bought a bunch of treasuries and that was rates went from two percent to five percent let me know there's two things going on here okay Freebird When I See Your Chart and you talk about laddering this and laddering that and X percent and all this kind of stuff I think about the smartest guys in the room okay this is long-term capital low management this is Enron this is the 2008 bank failure they think they can basically do Financial engineering to mak

    "title":"Lessons from the SVB Capital’s Debacle",
    "summary":"In this video, four besties continue discussing about the collapse of SVB Capital. They examine the causes and the lessons to be learned. The causes of the collapse include the mismatch between monthly bills and annual payments, the lack of governance in some companies and the regulatory treatment of assets. The lessons learned include the importance of holding people accountable, matching the timing of cash flows, the need for regulatory oversight and the danger of popularity contests. They also argue that some of the blame lies with SVB Capital and its poor risk management."
